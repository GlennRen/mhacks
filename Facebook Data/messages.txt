As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

No. All I use is FB.
.___________.
Now's good lol.
bye. lol. 
Alrite no problem. Good luck!
Idk. I guess so.
Yep. These essays are tough.
And use examples from when you used these to succeed or help the people around you succeed.
http://blog.timesunion.com/careers/the-10-most-important-personality-traits-for-career-success/633/
You could try this website.
Lol. Yeah. Let's see.
You can't always be 100% honest in essays like these.
Remember while its good to be honest. Sometimes you just have to write what they want to hear.
Use the character traits you have. 
Yeah! That's a good idea. Because I read over one of my friend's appeal letters and made him rewrite it. This was cause he was trying to persuade the committee by saying why he was better. Don't do that! Just talk about character traits you have. Your friend 's definitely right!
Do you have a idea of what you're going to write about?
Yep that's a good idea so we can mainly focus on one topic.
Nicceee. Are you appealing for Global or SMCS or both?
Umm.
Yep. So, let's see.
Yep. I stiil swim, though I got a lot slower. Lol. Alrite. When your done or whatever I'll look it over I guess.
Do you need help editing the appeal letter?
Oh. Yeah. I know Arona. She swims on Germantown. Ummm. Yeah.
Who else is going to Global?
Damn. That Sucks!
SMCS or Global?
No. I'm going to Poolesville. SMCS.
I didn't appeal dueee.
?
Yooo.
yeah.
it's like 40 minutes
The bus ride sucks
It's alright.
How's?
How NW?
haha yeah
Oh dang.

I'd love to go!
do you have a link
why?
yeah I do
just depends on what we're planning for
depends
sometimes its mixed and sometimes its not
I'm still waiting to see who runs for what
hallway
tshirts
fundraising for prom
I can't decide whether I want to run for whole school treasurer or class president
yeah
nah
nay
Zach is also running
nick?
him
so I'll have to beat hi,
Eric is also running for a second term next year
I am haha
I've been thinking about it
why?
I'll see what I can get
lmao
I'm probably gonna intern at fiscalnote this summer
I was under the impression that only captain's raised money
I did
yeah
and the business cards of the founders @ fiscal note
But I have the business cards of the ceo of cipher tech
though*
a lot of times, they don't like giving it out thought
I know a couple of them but I'll ask
yep
I'd look at their sponsor list cause that could give you an idea of who might be interested in giving money into the  technology field
I'm friends w/ the guys who runs it and their sponsors are insane
http://bitca.mp/
last one was a UMD
cause a season is ending
oh well not for a while
you know what they are?
hmm
yeah just thought you might be interested
a group of first teams all over the world
anyways, you probably want to join first robotics network on facebook
that's one way of looking at it
pity position tbh
but yeah definitely, its sounds cheesy af but team comes first
idek
mr. lee made me a junior captain or something like that
yeah
forgot who
yeah its was one of the seniors who told me that
phineas and ferb
the only thing is that trishul and diwakar do the same thing
I'd say bitter not mad
yeah i guess
and make logical decisions
at anything but I'm glad diwakar and trishul are cause its at least people that I respect
I just hate losing
not really
not yet cause I wasn't captain yet and didn't care to ask
cause companies at other tech events are more likely to donate money (compared to cold emailing)
others*
Well I know the CEO of FiscalNote, ciphertech, and some other
not really
I spend a lot of my time going to hackathons and a lot of those people do first too so I kinda have a idea for fundraising
of course
yeah ik
I have no words
and btw was the video made in movie maker?
hmmm interesting
nevermind
since when...
cause you invited me to like the facebook page
lol
do you do pr for first?
When does it come?
Lmao this boms shirt tho
haha alright go head
doesn't he take long walks with her lmao
I've heard
ah I see
a lot of people didn't think it was that good
idk
+ I heard wallops was oversiced
was actually kinda looking forward to it
no boms
yeah :'(

can I cop a ride?
you driving?
Hey are you going to Alex and Abby's today?
haha. jk. its okay i guess.
yep. i love life.
same lol.
sups?
Yo.
We'll just do it Monday and keep her updated
She has to run Physics club
She can
Sreya said she can't meet on Monday
Alright cool
And he's interviewing right
When?
Yeah
Who?
At home
I just wrote the prompt but I'll see what I can do tomorrow
Yeah go ahead
That's a good idea
yeah
Kenneth, Kevin M. And a kid called Maxwell
nah
Looks like we're gonna have to add a day on Tuesday
Yeah
And I made them their own mailing list
Nah
Oh yeah I can fix it if anyone responds
Weren't we gonna have them respond if they had conflicts
What do you mean by make sure everyone is okay with their assigned date?
It'll be a lot quiter
Ideally 199 though
Yeah
What?
I don't want someone coming up to us afterwards and complaining that they never got the memo
Just in case someone missed it
In case anyone missed it
We should still post the survey in the senior Facebook group though
We're basically done unless anyone else wants to apply
That's cool
That ain't even bad
Just saw it oops
That'd be too savage lmao
Chill out
Matthew?
What do you mean
I guess we can send out a schedule and rearrange people as necessary
Ohhh hmm
You and Ishan can't do Friday right?
electrical is done in 3 days
A troll lol
that's 4 days
Yeah that works
Especially people that we don't know
It's better if we have second opinions on people
Or who have shown significant interest
Those are people who should be strongly considered
that's orange
The only person that's red is Trishul
Who is red?
blue is returner who needs to tryout
Okay that's fine
Everyone in green doesn't need to tryout
I'm trying to figure out who we're going to have interview who
That basically narrows it down to Karl and Cole then
Are you wondering what Karl wants to do?
It's really not that big of a deal
Who else would we have as head of CAD?
That's just Trishul lmao
Pink?
We're making Azeem captain right?
Yeah
Green for returner
Ok that's fine
Yeah
Check interview schedule
I did
Alright I'm on
That's all I've done today
yeah lol
I'm almost done with Grendel so can you get on at 3:15?
Are you doing it now
I'm thinking 10 minutes
Yeah let's go on tomorrow and assemble the schedule
oh mailing list lol
I made a new 2017 PR with the people who are interested in joining PR + us
just making sure
yeah
Do we want to interview people who want to join PR or nah
Nah it was clear
Gold
haven't started but might have some stuff from previous years
tell her to message me
I'll send him an email tonight and then ask in person tomorrow
looks good
Idk why but the formatting is always weird on my phone
alright just read over it
We gotta send a email back to John Poole
i'll have it in time for poolesville day tho and arjun should have it soon
not done yet :/
That and we can't have a half assed booth
Like I had the organizer move us
Sure but you realize we're on the main road right
That's fine just save it as a draft and I'll look it over
Were we really expecting him to tho?
That's rachet af
Or are we literally just gonna have the shooter
We gotta get the booth planned out
Yeah
The thing is tomorrow is the day I'm telling curran I'm dropping srp lmao
Shouldn't be that much stuff
Nevermind
Can't you skip 1 day of practice?
Sure
Karl said he could probably go to the workshop at RM and Wally's probably going be representing FTC
can you do it in the morning?
alright cool
tomorrow can you print out some of the chipotle posters and ask the office if we can hang them up?
that's a reminder for me
no, it'll be done when it's done
hip
in the shared folder, we gotta update that
check the grant document
I asked the organizer and he said that he's estimating 300 people
get as many people to come to our chipotle fundraiser after the event
like at the event
I'm just trying to push the fuck out of Chipotle fundraiser
I'll check in a sec
poolesville day is fun af tho
Have one of us go to Poolesville Day and the other one go to the workshop the day after
I'm thinking about divide and conquer
nah you good
exactly
What do we wanna say
cause apparently she's dean kamen's niece
we gotta chill though
that's libby's email
lkamen@unither.com
You can have a different chat for programming, mechanical, electrical, and captains
It's super easy doing that in Slack lol
^^ that's a good idea
I think Matthew would really step up
I'll ask him right now
I think
yeah
hip^
I think Ishan might
Yeah just minimize the team fee as much as possible
I think you said 10k in the email
they literally have our bot
If we don't get Unither, we gotta raise a shit storm
hopefully if we're able to fundraise 10k
That's the goal
and we're basically done for FTC
they're literally seperate grants
nah
these kids wildin
both of them asked to be on FTC too this year
The funny thing is
son I still need to study for this new SAT
I mean juniors
maybe we can send one of the sophomores
I mean we just need someone there
Sunday 10-4, and then the fundraiser starts at 5.
I mean I'm going to be super busy too
I saw both
If we go, we'd probably have a much better change of convincing some teams of going to the fundraiser too.
It's on Sunday right before the fundraiser and he said the RM, Blair and Whitman would all be there.
Hey, so a friend of mine who used to be the captain of Northwest's FTC team is holding a workshop next weekend at RM.
i get what you're trying to do but i'm just not feeling it right now
it's cool though
we are friends
cause just ain't into her like that
nigga back up
idk man
We gotta put in work this week
I'm hip
what about you or praneeth?
bruh
in our group?
Theresa probs
i gotta know who's matching this shit
that's it? lol
who's going w/ who?
lmao
why?
idk I haven't really thought about it
I mean the main two are United Therapeutics and NASA now
Yeah
NASA just sent us an email about their grant
Looks good
Can you add in the second part
Alright I wrote the part about FLL
I'll do it now
Oh shit forgot
We gotta get this approved by Friday
Yeah I can
I'll try again tomorrow
I still have the paper since by the time I went to go look for her, Krouner was gone
Lit
Lot
http://www.wusa9.com/mb/entertainment/television/programs/great-day-washington/free-chipotle-on-sundays-in-september/310580969
but?
cause it has to be approved 2 week before the fundraiser right?
alright cool
lol Krouner was trying to say that the club sponsor had to fill it out
Did you find Mr. Lee today?
I could but I was going to wait until that date got closer to do another post with the flyer
yeah* I got you
oh shit year
You wanna BS it together in Chipotle on the 28th
Same
What book are you reading for English
Nah you good just thought I'd ask
Lol*
You trying to go to this little l
I'm trying to get more people but I don't know who to ask
We gotta get these RM kids too
But Peter should be cool
I feel like JJ gonna be a little butthurt
Might as well send it out anyways
Like who does that
Literally they met in the morning on week days
I hope not
We can sent it out tomorrow morning since it's kinda late
Check the draft
Just kinda hard since I'm running around all day lmao
I'm doing it right now
Yeah gotchu
np
yeah I'm pretty sure
Sohn usually just checks notes in class and hands the journal back that period
Are you planning on staying the entire time?
We can talk about it at Chipotle lol
Money wise is tough
But you just have way too many people trying to organize logistical stuff
FTC isn't bad
Save me
There's literally no organization whatsoever
The FTC chat is a clusterfuck
Yeah
Yo
Yeah but they're asking if we want the same booth
Were you at Poolesville Day last year?
It just looks good on college apps
I'm pretty pressed about it lol
When does national merit come out
Yoo
I have no idea but I'm afraid to find out
Lmao we'll see
If I can get a beer
I'm gonna ask my parents
Thanks man
Ayyyy
Props to them for starting something though
As in money to buy food, t-shirts and other swag
And because there's not asking for large amount of money but sponsorship
It's a terrible idea
Idk
I think they've actually already met with a couple
they're like prepping to meet with council members
I've been trying to keep up but that email chain is long as hell
I kinda feel like we should go to one of these tho
And my personal email account so I'm getting this shit twice
plus they keep emailing both the phsfirstrobotics
Yeah
I go by it every day
You know that place in Columbia we went to test our robot
Bruh
Yeah
Two
That works
That's cool
Sure why not
Saturday?
Can you do Germantown again?
Same
Like around 2
Yeah I'm gonna be a bit late though
Sounds good
The time depends on what time we're doing fireworks
Oh shit
What time is it?
I don't really read the chat so I'm not really sure what's going on
What time are they doing fireworks or whatever
It
I doesn't matter
Nah
Yeah
I can do early monday
Yeah
Near the windows
I'm on the second floor at a desk on the far left
We're doing Germantown right?
4 hours gives us a lot of time to do research together and just talk things over
2:30 sounds good
What time works for you?
Yeah I can do that
I can't do today but any day next week after 5 would work
yeah i was thinking that too
Plus we're probably gonna have to stay for multiple days
Sure but we don't have a definite time yet
I think he just meant me and you but we might not be able to clean up everything
Mr. Lee wants us to come in sometime to clean up the FIRST stuff in 199
You wanna meet with him and curran?
I just wanna be well prepared if he tries to flame in any way
Cause Lee can be...unpredictable
I'd like to do some more research and look through the rest of the emails first and then have the meeting
I was actually thinking that we need to get on these grants asap
Yeah
https://m.youtube.com/watch?ebc=ANyPxKoqFR2ccgJwDTYYfPKqYraRQ0jyD8NjwYgOFHdwJ-K1ZPt7NVEAIHG_DXQ2yhOqQ774KP7W7sLF-bjQwX_dOg0TdFgkzQ&v=Wlo7EPqyGB8
He's evolved
The legend
And I guess group unread emails and I just marked them as done
I'm using a Google app called Inbox
Is that bad?
?
I'm going to really get going once APs are over
I have a idea
How much will that cost?
Not yet we don't
We'd also have to fix up the bot
275 i think
You get a discount of $50 if we register before august 1st
Cause it's only 36 teams
ASAP
Let's do battle of baltimore
We're assigned to St. Louis but tbh Houston seems more lit
If we make it we can request a change
Yeah but as a FRC team
One in St. Louis and one in Houston
There are two FIRST championships now
It can't hurt to at least get in contact with them
filled*
I fill out the form
I think it's legit
Ill look at it in the bus
Ight
Headass lolol
Lol what a headaaa
I just saw him in the Germantown library
Lol yeah
Rodger I think
And looks like a pedophile
Who was this dude who ran cross country our freshman year
Mans
But who is this mana
I know
?
yeah I know
I'll get you with the next one
pls
can you hmu
bumpppp
Did you finish?
No idea
MIt app inventor is straight ass
Exactly
Did you finish this MIT app inventor shit
Alright good looks
But I will be
Not at school yet
We'll see after people apply
Hopefully not
The interview questions
Oh not the open house
Like have a day where people can see what we do idk
That let us get a feel for the type of person they are
Nah
And having a "open house"
Like good ones
Just interview questions
For admissions
I have a couple ideas
We place them after they make the team
Cause many of them don't actually understand what each subteam does
I'm thinking that we don't have new members try out for subteams
But fuck over the current sophomores
We avoid having headasses
It's good and bad
hip
for forgetting this lmao
ur a headass
Jagan wasn't on the team ya dofus
Just ride Matthew and Parth
That's true e
Yeah
And not forget that's they're using the wrong branch
Log
These niggas need to document
Not entirely
Although a huge part of that was testing
I'm not trying to have what happened this year, also happen next year
Code
But someone who follows directions and writes polished core
I'm not saying we need a chump
It's not hard but more of minimizing mistakes
Yeah
For programming
We need to find a freshman though
Lol yeah
But I think Parth is still probably the way to go
But then had a bunch of stuff come up
I felt that he was really into it in the beginnning
And then kinda fell off
Matthew went super hard in the beginning of the season
Those*
That was the exact people I was thinking
We don't need Karl doing CAD if someone else can do it
Yeah
Btw what were you thinking for heads?
Cause that way we can use the people on the team as a comparison for the people trying out
Like even the people who were on the team last year
And I was thinking that this year everyone interviews
I can talk to some of the people I know
Cause some of those kids actually like writing
Idk
For PR
I was thinking of bringing in humanities kids
Let's make a spreadsheet after APs
I had a small one and I'm gonna combine mine with Karl's
Yeah same
+ you started a list of sponsors right
Wait what do you wanna do for PR?
It's not like you do anything in class anyways lmaoo
Son apparently it was due last Friday
Did you finish the fusion tables shit?
I thought you had already sent it lol
Yeah that seems better
See ya
Lol alright
Practical works
Interviews*
Interview don't help much
But from what I've heard, it's not very practical
No idea yet
Like interviews are not the move
And I wanna change up the process of getting onto the team
Well, at least for the freshman
Both
That's true
About FIRST
To the school
Ok
Yeah I'm planning on advertising super hard next year
But I don't remember who
They have also been a couple of people who have said that they wanted to do PR
Ok
We need to make a new emailing list
It sounds fine
I go back and forth
Do you want to have a dedicated PR team?
We're gonna have to talk to Mr. Lee and Curran first
Hmm
That's what I was thinking too
Ite sounds good
Do you wanna send out a email today?
Lmaooo
It's lit 
It's probably better if we do it tomorrow morning
I'd high five you through this screen if I could
Check your email
Sonnnnn
This is the biggest struggle
Nigga it's almost midnight
They literally said "this afternoon"
Son
Lmaooo
It's so good 
I remember him working on the vision
oh yeah I remember now
But it felt like Kent carried them this year
Parth seems like he kinda knows what he's doing
That man picks his battles
Yeah you're right
I hate this kinda shit
What if Matthew runs?
Woah
For his own sake
I hope he doesn't
I feel like he might
I'm hipppp
Do you know what you're gonna say yet?
Likewise lol
Just wanted to make sure
Yeah that's what I was thinking too
You trying to run together or nah
Yo
Why?
Not sure
Yeah you right
When is Lee collecting journals?
Comung
alright
other than ourselves and the t-shirt
We don't need to bring anything for FIRST right
yeah we'll find a grocery store
Cause I have nothing.
What food do you have?
What time do we need to be at Harshal's house tomorrow?
Nah, no fucking way I'm not going
and now they're saying that if I'm tired, I shouldn't go tomorrow
I went home and took a nap
My parents are being salty as shit
That man is too much sometimes
I don't know
I'm just not trying to get kicked out
Yeah you right
what about the check in age
did you find  a hotel?
Alright
What days are you staying?
Yeah I should be able to. Why?
My parents are still on the fence about it
Um
Yeah
Are you not going on Saturday?
Oh damn that's nice
to see your sister?
ayy
After spring break I have 3 back to back to back hackathons lmao
I need this break
Same
that's wild
my gawd
So you're skipping Friday?
You right
wtf is that
Boy
Why Wednesday?
It's the CSAW thing
Are you coming to school Thursday?
Ugh, gotta go hard this week
Cause they're don't want me doing nothing but FIRST for ANOTHER weekend
I think I just need to convince my parents that stay at the hotel legit saves time
Maybe
But that's a mission.
I think my parents might let me stay Saturday night
Really
What's your plan for getting to Bel Air?
He about to be like "you guys should be up to date anyways"
I know
Did he say he was checking for sure
But my parents aren't about to let me do that
I am too
We'll get home at like 10.
If we make playoffs next weekend, I'm not coming to school on Monday
I swear
For the general structure, I think we're pretty good
Yep
Yeah I'm hip
and we really need to be more organized
I've been looking at how other teams are structured
Yeah
Apparently next year is supposed to be weird af
https://www.reddit.com/r/FRC/comments/470yro/first_4_year_game_cycling_theory/
Yo
Yeah
This thing is a monster
I'll bring my speaker haha
The mini-van?
Yeah I do
Does your car not have one?
To Whitman
Can I get a ride?
What time are you leaving tomorrow
True
Why?
I don't want to either
No idea
Are you going to school tomorrow
we have to get there first though haha
I know you just have to be a top ranked team at the district championships
Not sure
I'm trying to figure it out
After districts you have to go to district championships
At one point I just like fuck it
Yeah same
And I'll convert the first stronghold text to vector tomorrow
See ya
Though
I need to actually sleep tough
Like off the top of your head do you actually remember where it was on the shirt
Do we need falcons first though
Maybe put that there onstead
That's what I'm saying
And make the sponsors gold
Put in the first stronghold
I rather take out the castle on top
Like what?
Who'd you lose to?
When you push PHS to our best ever finish but McKenna still doesn't know how to spell
White
Should the sponsors be gold or white?
I think so
We're gonna order between tomorrow morning and tomorrow afternoon
Can't fade
I gotta wake up at six tomorrow
I'm gonna sleep dude
Yeah but I feel like it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the shirt
Are you going to school tomorrow?
What font did vineet use?
Yeah
I like that
That
That's extruded outside
Nahh
So teams know our #
Cause like you said it'll pop
I thought gold originally but now I'm thinking white
I mean the logo is a emblem
True
Like something more modern
Is the another font though
Yeah It looks better inside
On the outside of the logo
The #
What does it look like on the outside?
The logo was too big in the pictures vineet posted in my opinion
I think outside looks better
Yeah
That way people immediately know what team we're from
Now that I think about it we should have it on the front
Tbh though
I think it's cleaner without it
Idk
Last year Falcons first was tiny
Do we need both
I know me too
Suriya wanted to put Falcons first on the front and the # on the back
That was a bad idea
Yeah
yeah that's too much
ugh
I don't see 3.50 though
where do you see that?
for what??
I think it might cost a little extra
That might work
do we want it really big
we might be able to put it on the pocket
like it was either too high or too low
vertically
I felt like putting the 4099 above and below made the logo too offcenter
the think was
idk
That's what I'm trying to figure out
I know
the sponsors are black cause the shirt was originally white
does that work?
http://www.customink.com/designs/frcshirt/fse0-00af-ntrh/hotlink?pc=HL-142344&utm_campaign=hotlink_201601&utm_source=hotlink&utm_medium=email&utm_content=viewbutton&cm_mmc=hotlink-_-5-_-Body_txt-_-viewbuttond
Yeah hold up
I don't really like the way 4099 looks on the front though
But I'm trying to put FALCONS FIRST somewhere
I was thinking of keeping the front simple just the logo
And the metallic gold print should shine
Like I feel like people would actually wear their shirts a lot more if it was grey
I was talking to Karl and white is kinda tacky
Yeah I agree
Like grey

I was thinking gold

Now that I think about it Matthew's going to have bigger problems on game day other than just safety
Nah
Sure
I'm sure there's a manual somewhere

That means we need a safety captain other than diwakar
SHITT

I told you
D:
Ok.
I never found how to do that
yeah
can you do that?
and after make cats1 = i on the next run and so on
when 'i' is 0 make cats0 = i
for example:
if you want to make a new variable every time 
so for 'for' loops right
It's not directly about ACSL but programming in Python in general
Can I ask you a question?
yeah
your*
How long is you program?
OK thanks
Lol he took my phone.
Did we have any physics HW?

What did you name the flow?
I think
That's what I said

I saw the coefficent on the internet 'k' but I didn't know what to put as the value
what was your value for it?

Hey Matt! Sorry, it's just been really busy recently but I think I'm beginning to adjust to the high school life. haha. I usually don't get home until 5 and do homework until 9 or so. I'm not sure come if I can since the 31st marks the end of the quarter and I've been working to keep the grades up! I'll definitely try to go though. If I do, Saturday would work the best. Thanks!

Think
"He knocked in vain at the door that opens to golden keys" I tink
We just talked about how the narrator was glad that Mr. Odger was getting recognition for his work but bitter that it was only the lower class who recognized him
Oh I see
Our two tones were bitter and admiring. :/

haha yeah
it's like impossible
yet
we haven't brute forced it
we haven't done that yet
nice
tru
google it
look at the url
dude
yep
you don't even need to click anything
it's hard to find but you're going to feel like it's so obvious when you do
those aren't that important
:D
except that's not everything
good conclusion
there's no flag, just a clue to how to get one
twitter's not actually that important
nah
you just need to understand social media
haha
no just look more carefully
look at his whole twitter
he only has 30 tweets though

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

Yeah sure
This is such a mess
That's true
Homecoming is such a joke lol
Yeah that's a struggle
But I don't have the willpower to tell Ms. Hicks I'm not going
Cleaning up is such a bummer
I'm not sure what I'm gonna due yet
Yeah I'm so hip
Which is super lame
If I don't then I'll probably go to a UMD computer science event and then go clean up
I might go to Justin's house
Mikeys probably gonna go turn up
Paint was spray paint
2 plastic sets of skeleton pieces
Inflatable barrels that we may or may not use
Gold coins
Paint
A bunch of shit

Yeah definitely
Yeah just saw it for some reason I don't get notification s
Did you end up finding a folding table
night loser
I WILL
for sure
it'll be in her inbox

*shudder*
That girl in Nemo
It's tough
We're sending them to their graves...
Yeah
Yeah I guess
Actually, I don't want to know
I wonder how many of those fish are still alive
I KNOW
I think that's what we did last year
we can just give them away
I know
better to have more than less
If you get some extra it can't hurt
Ummm
http://www.petsmart.com/live-pet/live-fish/comet-goldfish-zid36-15410/cat-36-catid-700002

Technically
I guess
Well
It's underrated
Yep
Mmm 
We just all ended up going to kats house and watching Netflix haha
It sucked
Yeah
We have to help set up and tear down
Yep
Or actually it wouldn't be that hard
Cause packing everything up is going to be a struggle if they're not on sga
Are you able to work at the end
Cool
If she's willing to volunteer
Did you ask Theresa
I'll try
Oh ok
Why can't Kellert be there again?
Yeah
If you think of any others materials that we need for decorations, just add it to the list
Alright
If the tents not provided we might have to borrow Rachel's tent
Awesome
We should have just done it ourselves
I dont know what this lady is doing
It just needs to be finalized before I go
I'll do that tonight
The materials list isn't updated
I'll should be able to go this week
Can you put the people that have already signed up on the google doc
I'll ask Ms. Hicks again tomorrow
We never actually do anything at events like this
Yeahhh
I don't wanna go either
Yep
Yeah np
I saw a tweet from Poolesville SGA saying that an email was coming.
When are you talking about
I was just on it wtf
What?
Time?
Michaels house?
What's the t shirt
Let me put this in a Google doc
Alright
email*

summer*
hmu w/ designs over the sumemr

T-shirts are a big one
we don't have a lot tho
LIES
Squad
YAS
muhaha yes
lmao
We should start planning like mid august
Me too!
it's easy to buy pirate decorations
wth sam

this year is going to be fire
but hmm
Last year was embarassing
I was there for like half of it
I HAD A FOOTBALL GAME
fo sho
lol
Sam?
but I want it to be super nice
Yeah
so it's just bootstrapping and trying to save every dollar
I can literally make fake crates for POTC a engineer room
It's gonna require a lot of searching for free parts and donations
but I mean probably not a lot
It's up to us
either way this is going to require a lot of preparation beforehand
And the vending machines are cool too cause you can put something on it
have a HUGE thing in the middle
cause I'm trying to beat the seniors
A TON
yeah
I wanted to do Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when we started but POTC has been growing on me
I can see the ones that are text but not the images
...
lol nah
Pirates of the Caribbean would be easier to dress for
yeah
this is dopee
http://cinemavine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/3Pirates_of_the_caribbean_home_movie_theater.png
I think pirates would be nice af
I literally can't open any of them
can you message me pictures of the things they're sending in the group
In my opinion, Juniors have the best hallway
Hopefully
well those are the people who replied
Sophie Urban
Chris Danna
SMCS Kids
A lot of people have been wanting to do pirate of the caribbean
Idk
I can't view them from my phone
what are the picture in the group chat

YAYY :D
I'm sure you're much better than me at other things.
But coding is just my thing.
I know Python, Basic, Java, HTML and actionscript.

swimming winter
basketball fall
Not really sports but clubs
How many clubs do you think its possible to handle freshman year?
Nice! LOL.
Cause Jeanyoung was trying to convince me to do Science Olympiad....
Oh... 
^Thats pretty hardcore
Everything SMCS.
EVERYTHING STEM :D
are there any clubs you recommend at poolesville?
But that's just me lol
Personally I'm not a huge fan of those types of sweater
But don't you already have one like that?
It's nice
The sweater?
I haven't seen em yet
You got a link?
Did you see the FOG ones
Ohhhhh
Meme checker?
you right
Too fat lol
For me tight jeans just don't look right
I'm hoping
The bottom could be a little more tapered but I like the stretch
I've
I'm liked Uniqlo jeans
I heard their stuff fits pretty slim
I don't own anything from Zara
What'd you end up buying today?
I can't fade 100 lol
Jesus Christ
How much?
Making it look good is even harder
Throwing*
Throw a football is hard af
that'd be crazy
Yeah I've heard that too
Holy shit
Personally, I like ultraboosts better but I can't fade the price
Try a 9
Rippp
I was actually pretty suprised
Idk where else
Lol
are you really gonna buy anything about bape or supreme tho?
I like the black and red ones
But like is the 2nd floor open
Are they still under construction?
Really?
Like the NMD silhouette
If you really want em
Yeah in that case Id probably pass and wait for another color way to come out
Oh true
We can twin
I think the all white ones look nicer
Lol
I would but I feel like in NY they would get dirty real easy
Night 
So I can actually enjoy high school
I'm kinda at the point where I just want this to hurry up and be over
Like Matthew and Karan are just ridiculous
I feel like comp team captain is harder tho
Cause that's basically my main extracurricular
I'm planning on riding FIRST super hard
Those are just resume padders right
I'm just wondering so I don't go down the same rabbitholes
Like what?
It's the long run that really matters at the end of the day
Though I'm really not that pressed about it
That sucks :(
I feel like it's going to be impossible to get either of those with a independent project
that emoji is horrifying
oh god
:p
1500+
Oh shoot
but I'm hoping to get 2300+ but I'll see about that
right now I'm at 3.6/2210
on college apps
Does national merit matter
I'll do that thanks
What's a good number of schools to apply to
NYU is hard to get in too
but it's a reachhh
it seems like a really good school
lol
but I probably won't get in
Right now my #1 is Olin
without stressing myself out too much
I'm 80% sure I'm just going to Maryland so I'm just waiting for this year to be over
?
really
still can't decide
I'm thinking of studying CE over CS
thanks
You'd recommend dropping Physics C and sticking with SRP?
So you
?
should I switch to hon world
I have shannon for world
really
really?
cause I did that in addition to my internship at northrop
I'm literally half way done with my SRP
like my independent research project is kinda half baked
also SRP I'm trying to figure if I really want to go forward with my independent research project
she says it's just taking pictures
really
Heaton and McKenna
it's not too bad but I just have a lot of extracurriculars
right now my schedule is: SRP, MV, AP Lit, Physics C, AP World, Photo and programming languages
is the class hard
here's my current schedule
and probably another cs
I'd switch into pych instead of physics
that's pretty wild
damn
ohhh true
really?
BC?

I also have debate and FIRST so I'm thinking about nerfing my schedule
do colleges look at 1st semester grades?
you took ap physics c?
college apps*
cause of college app, and personal projects
but I'm thinking about dropping it just to make senior year easier
so right now I'm in physics c
hey I need some advice
everlane makes pretty good stuff
that thing is so nice
I got my heather grey hoodie from everlane
but really the only different is the bottom support right?
nicer*
the second one looks nices
but I'm broke af
I've looked at those too
ayyy lol
I really like the way chelsea boots look but I feel like I couldn't pull them off
:(
Superstars are dead tho
I really hope not but I feel like you're right
not sure
I feel like I have a general idea from just walking around soho this summer
true
o I was talking fits
what do you mean amazing
but that's just me
personally, I'm not a huge fan of supreme
Yeah I've seen a couple people with those backpacks
are you sure they're real? hah
fobs
ofc
why did some people have nice ass fits
Kith is hella expensive man
for what?
not to really buy anything but just to look around
I like Kith
uhhhh
what's the difference between tandon and cas?
fuccbois everywhere
I'll bet
Come backkkkkkk
I'm soooo scared I'll get them dirty
they're the mesh ones not the primeknit
I caught the restock
all white
or actually a couple days ago
copped a pair of NMDs yesterday
that makes sense
gotcha
memon?
how come he's not going to NYU?
our school is hella stacked
true
her bio says aspiring photographer and computer scientist lmaoo
Didn't you say he carried her hard af?
Oh damn
That man is winning on all cylinders of life
I just saw Gus' girlfriend
Dagnabit
I*
I'll should be in NYC soon tho
Probably won't catch you before school starts
Dang
When are you leaving for NY?
Ahh good shit
Damn, who's going?
Nah I'm still in Mexico
might as well do that than nothing at all
you're right tho
It's interesting to me now but I'm not sure if I'm really interested or that's just the impostor syndrome in me
and people use JS for everything these days
like there are SOOO many different random ass frameworks
I know but it's pretty easy to get sucked into
but it's honestly not that great
like I'm getting pretty decent at webdev
I really have no idea what I want to do anymore
yeah i saw haha
alright thanks
installing opencv in general is not fun at all
I can imagine lol
yeah right now I'm leaning towards mac
at the same time osx looks really good for dev and all the other stuff I wanna do
by jumping into arch
but I kinda want to force myself to learn it better
yeah
sometimes if you know what I'm saying
I want to become more familiar with linux but at the same time it's driving me insane
I know Chris got one
I'm really considering getting a macbook pro since my laptop is killing me
I need some advice
are you back in the states?
that*
that's blows
damnnn
on ios10 the ar doesn't work but many people don't use that anyways
I just wouldn't know what to do lol
that's part of the reason I haven't jailbroken
I have no idea
lol same
you can download themes right?
I'm on iOS 10 rip
On finishline
Chuck 2s are on sale for $30
PSA
Like Philly NY and boston
Cause me and a friend are trying to go to some east coast cities
Dang ir
Oh true
So no adult?
We're you guys by yourselves?
Did you guys airbnb?
You guys went to NY last summer right?
Yo
wow twins
lmao I'm really not trying to do one more year
what has this world come to
OH SHIT
cause I doubt it's someone from my year
oh yeah
probably a underclassmen group then
hmmm
true
probably nick
I looked on ABCTF and that was one of the team name's from poolesville
Wrong person then dang it
Do you need money for overwatch?
I'm sure you'll have fun torturing us
Eh
It'd be wild if I one mand
And then you have the sophomores
Like Matthews returning with Karan and SK
I'll try lol but I don't know of any good teams
I thought you weren't gonna do it
Concrete jungles make ya feel brand new
Newwww Yorkkkkkk
When do ya move in?
Do ya know any good pen testing tutorials?
I'm not sure about jack pike tho
I think Christian Johnson is
She's in the cubicle across from me and is basically the only person I talk to lmao
Yeah
She's the only one I know who was there last year
Yeah
You know Natalie?
Not sure
Beggars can't be choosers
I wanted to do the one you told me about with the car
Did it work?
I'm just frustrated
Sorry, I know I sound bitchy af right now
it just sucks
so I understand the assignment
I'm just better at web
It's not like I'm not good at Cyber
Yeah
Now I really just use it for fun hax and stuff
Web is what got me into programming which is why I have experience with it
That's the plan
They blocked off a cubicle
Nina's still there but she moved into a HR role
This is literally what my team members did today
Who was the coordinator
So I didn't say anything
I didn't need to use Northrop for srp
If feel like it's late af tho
Ya feel
But I don't wanna work either
I don't wanna dick around
I was gonna go every Friday and stuff
But that fell apart at the last minute
For computer vision
I talked to Lee and I was gonna do something @ UMD
I just kept my head down and took it
Nah
Should I talk to Ellen?
Damn
And I'm 99% sure I had a stronger resume than philip
Except me and my team members
Everyone is
Yeah
That kinda stuff
If I was act Google I rather work on the projects at Google x than develop software ya feel
Like
Inside
Otherwise I feel dead insife
I NEED to work on something that I'm passionate about
Yeah I'm just not sure what to do
Yeah I will
But I had other interns show me around
Nah
But I honestly just wanna work on something I'm passionate about
I'm seen some stuff at Northrop that's super cool
People are nice though
Plus front-end engineers never get credit
But I feel like I'm wasting my time
I wanna be a team player, I'm new and a high schooler so I don't wanna flip too many rocks over
The actual work just blows
I like the people I'm working with
No
They just know Spring a bit better
They're not even good
Like hate it with a passion
It's boring and I rather be doing something else
Except I hate doing front end
We're build a web app and since they already learned Spring, they assigned me to the front end
It's a Java backend
The two weeks before I started, my two other team members were doing tutorials on this thing called Spring
So I need some advice
I got a question
Yo
But we're not even in a irad lmao
Yeah
But I was wondering if putting in extra hours is worth it
Like I'm going to do good work
So no
Is there a point in being super try hard?
Can't really tell though
I think Estep likes me
Does Estep write good recs?
Just a random question
redsn0w
I haven't jailbroken anything in years
How do these guys even figure it out
Af
Glitchy ag
I'm on iOS 10
I have no idea how I would go about doing that
Lmao
It's all C#
So I guess I could do something with that
And vr is dope
Estep let me borrow the oculus
True
Do you know of anyone who did a good independent project?
Yeah I heard smh
Lmao
But those guys are geniuses
Aren't most of the really legit Intel projects independent projects
But I feel like you can only go so far
Like I'm been learning about how edge detection and corner detection works
But Idk
I wanna do computer vision
I guess
But I'm not sure how I would go about it
That's what I was thinking
Rather do 2 projects
But I really don't have the heart to BS something
I know
But none of them wants a intern that only comes in 1 day a week
Like I emailed a shit ton of researchers from UMD
It's not even that I don't wanna do SRP either
Lee would whoop my ass but I'll live
Worst case scenario I don't do SRP
I don't think so
nothing new but nothing exciting either
just web dev stuff
It's ight
I didn't know what to expect but everyone was really nice
A lot more chill than I expected
It was good
Tomorrows a wednesday so I should be good
I just have nothing in particular that im tryin bring
Tru
Thanks
Dagnabit
Is there a cafeteria
Do they expect me to start producing on the 1st day?
Should've sent it earlier :/
It's kinda late lmao
She changed my start date
Yeah
I was supposed to on monday
I'll still go to the main building I guess
But there's no orientation
Ight
?
If there's no orientation tomorrow, should I still to to the main building
You still there?
But I asked Jennifer mcadoo if I could start tomorrow and she said it was fine
I was going to start this monday
Cause they only have it on mondays
My first day is tomorrow but I'm not going to orientation
Thank god
Ight
:/
And my parents scheduled something for Monday and Tuesday next week
My first day is tomorrow
How many days
What's Northrop's policy if I'm going on vacation
Yo
Kent Ma missed a call from Glenn Ren.
Editing*

Do you know what nudie jeans are?
Hey do you know what version of the oculus we have?
Bruh it hurts to swallow 
I got strep somehow and this shit is contagious
Hey I can't go today
Apparently it's broken into 2 rounds
Sure
Do you guys have a group chat or something?
what a time
Matthew throwing a fit is something I would pay to see
Ok
Can I join your team?
Damn
Alright cool
I'm not trying to go alone
I guess
Bruh Ishan was on our team
This is ridiculous
None of my group members are going
Y'all are too much
Literally everyone is flaking
Who's on your Metropolis team?
Bruh
out*
I keep forgetting to grab the pdf out of his hand in
Nah
Overall their year was pretty headass in general if we're being honest
I don't know what the fuck happened last year
he literally put all of us into the goon squad
Literally half of this is Brandon's fault
that's so sad but so true
lmaaoo
I'll be there this weekend
I would be there dude
yeah I know
From what I've seen on reddit, our event last week was an anomaly
I'm saying on our part
So everything should be a lot more controlled
There should be less people at Bel Air this week
I know
the event should run a lot more smoothly this week
than halfway
might as well do it first
Yeah
Got through inspection asap
alright
longest possible time
?
Worst possible situation
How long will that take?
What are the division parts of the code that you need to test?
Dammit
Oh I see
for me
Ok, bug the shit out of Diwakar
Can you test Friday?
Fuck man
What do you still need to do when it comes to testing?
Sorry man
whatever we can manage
but I'll try to get you as much time one Saturday
I won't be there tomorrow
Did we end up getting it on?
What was the problem with it?
That's it?
Damn
What did we still have to do?
what
Did you get to test today?
How come?
Bruh we got beat by wheaton last week
Kill
I don't want to change entire board just for the battery though
Damn
But can't we just mount it somewhere else
The battery don't fit
I've been saying
What happened
Lol k
so we can all have a visual of what's it's going to look like
I'm just waiting for cad to model it
are you sure?
scratch that
like the wheels might not spin at the same exact speed every time
but sometimes it's the parts used
yeah
cause we need to make our shooter super accurate
so yeah I guess
I think it's really mechanical, electrical and programming working together seamlessly
kinda
I mean if worst comes to worst, we can go for the low goals
terribly*
or suck terriblely
Our bot has the potential to be really nice
oh true
what*
for whaT?
Alright but I won't know that for sure until I model the board
true
?
compared to other teachers
and I don't think estep will be that anal about the actual due date
cause I have other stuff to do
are you gonna do it?
have you done your paper yet
I just wanted to know how many pages it was
I think it's pretty casual
no idea
yeah
I thought we were turning them in together
isn't it due tomorrow?
yeah
How long was our Cyber paper supposed to be?
ite thx
baller
...
cause I've heard different things
How long was your cover letter
Alright nice
Should I apply online and email the recruiter?
That's what I'm doing
Yeah
should I do that?
Recruiter?
Just that?
Should I submit a cover letter w/ my application to Northrop?
Where was the list of the info saying how many image there are next round and what they are?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ilS6pa5jx5sAnVttkkOCChZEcxYI8C0eP540m-DSZ-k/edit?usp=sharing

https://www.twitchinstalls.com/
I only read 3/4 of my book and I'm not trying to finish the last 1/4

We really want to get it on our own
Malrio ware
We can't get the problem they have
Idk
We'd have a better chance as well
I don't know why I'm telling you this but they wanna trade
I guess it's always easier in hindsight

Hey,
As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB. Thanks!
yeah...
Kill em.

ohhhh
yep
number = int (input(">>> "))
factors = []
for i in range (1, number+1):
    if number%i == 0:
        factors.append (i)
print (factors)
Lol just realized how inefficient my past code was
fixed it I see.
haha
too hardcore
lol
I'm just testing
is that right?
# GCF
gcf=lambda x,y:x if y==0 else gcf(y,x%y)
print(gcf(int(input("GCF\n>>> ")), int(input(">>> "))))
same haha
lol
input statement?
Code doesn't work.
Sounds fun
Ehhh
So a simple version of the stuff we do in first electrical?

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB. Thanks!
Oh OK cool.

Do you have the video?
Np

i'll ask calvin

Hey, no rush but how's the video coming along?
Ok. thanks
Have you looked at the film yet?
Hey Danny, where would be a good place to film this type of video?
both.

How long will it take you to edit though? 
What days and times in the next 2 weeks would be best for you? 
What else do you need from us? 
Do you need Calvin's script? 
About how long will it  take you to edit after we are done filming? 
OK. So I met with Calvin and we came up with a list of questions. 
I'll get back to you soon
ok thanks
or should calvin just get his speech ready?
do you need anything from us?
We just need a sense of what we need to do now
Do you think you could do the video editing too?
yeah 
when do you think you would have the most free time
?
when do you think you could film and where's the best place to film something like this?

Yeah.
My methods of communication are down D:
Oh...idk then
I suppose you could. But at the moment I'm waiting for my HTC One to come in the mail so I don't see how that could do any good...
:O What's Happening?
How's the end of the school year going for you?
So
Mmmmm. Definitely!
Sometimes. I usually have homework on Thursdays though...so it depends. And yeah, LOTR is pretty awesome!
Wow! That's really cool. Lord of the Rings! :3 sorry... I was at basketball practice...

#theproblems
nicee
Yep! I saw it :D
yeah :(
Of course! YOU HAVE BEN :D
But Amy's. Amy.
But you have Ben dudeee
I mean she is 3 years older than me...
But that was a completely pointless convo
-.-
Bruhhhhhhhh.
Well that was a bad idea...
Lol. Amy xD
1 of them were actually right!
You're*
Thank you :D and your actually a mediocre guesser.
Yep
Btw. Here's a hint. They're not married...
No dip Sherlock...
.______________.
Think.
Oh. Nah. I don't think that's a problem.
Nice!!
Dude I have a 4.0
Why thank you that gives me hope.
Swag mastah
Try again. Just notice that I didn't explicitly say anything yet...
Try again.
Try again.
Try again.
Don't worry it's not you. Whether that's reassuring or not...
Lol. Yeah they're just this person I like who's older than me and by the time I'm 16 they'll be in college D:
Hahaha. That 16 rule is killing meh. And the fact that I'm 13... 14 in August...
Do what you feel is right I guess.
Really? I wish life was that easy D:
Lucky you!
Not exactly in that order.
My goals: become SMOB, make Harvard and meet my Juliet :D
What
Yea?
Yep yep
Ohhhhh. See I don't have these problems :$
I don't know who that is...
Trust me. Ben is much better looking... Lol.
Yeah but usually the guy is either a jock or is very smexy.
Oh idk
I thought it was 4?
Haha. It was a hit on Sarah sorta thing for him
:'D good times
And hiding Amy's phone...
I was very involved in my food.
-.-
I wish I had the manliness to do something like that though...
Really? Good luck! ;)
Uhh...
I have to commend him though
Most def
And you have Ben which makes it even more awkward
Hmphhhh. What did he expect to get from hitting on you??
Woah. That's intense dude. I thought LDS youth can't date until  16?
Maybe I could learn a few tips LOL
Hmmm.
See most of the younger guys are more introverted.
That's different^
Yep!
Love has no limits! xD
Yeah?
13 year old Swag mastah
Haha song reference. Never mind
And Ellie goulding!!
Hey idk... Some people.
I was like wat...
Yeah. But I have a friend who went to prom and homecoming with a junior...
Lol. Isn't it kinda strange for a 13 year old to hit on a 17 year old?
Really? -.-
Yayyy. Me too :D
Oh ok. Don't count the days that he leaves. Be glad that he's still here :D
Yeah... Long distance is a bummerr
Well you gotta be glad that he's studious. Lol
Noooo. BYU right?
That's more like it! Haha.
probably?
maybe I'll sign up next year!
What do you need to be to cocaptain?
.__.
hmm. that sounds like fun!
thats kinda strange. I thought he was like 12...
haha
lol
ohh
:3
and his amazing hair
4 years isn't too bad. beside the fact that you have ben.
akwardddd
kind of yeah
ehhh. I'm sure they can turn the heat up haha
Christmasss
Yeah, that'll be awesome!
Or that I'm just awkward Lol 
I have problems communicating with younger children...
absolutely.
and that would be awesome
.____.
I think Amy said she'll stay too. Well if you guys don't end up staying then you'll have to come visit over break. because I'll be lonely
but hey, you never know.
19...
Maryland. Like a boss.
you guys must come visttt.
Yeah but I've never really known them...
AND THEN I'LL BE ALONE D:
Next year it'll be you and Amy.
Alice, and Emerald are leaving.
:'(
:/(
and amy
That suck D:
awww
what?
Talk to you later.
No prob.
Yeah. I'm actually probably getting baptized this year when I was going to 5 years ago.
My bad. Haha. I never came much either
Oh. I've been here since I was 2? I think and I just had never known you.
I never saw you around before this year. Was that just me being clueless?
and btw
Like I actually remember everyone being in primary and us singing. but wow.
Yeah. I just can't believe it. 
For example, I used to think Amy was 1-2 years older than me, but she's 17 and I'm 13. Whatttttttt.
Well for everyone but me.
Amy drove me home the other day and I was just surprised at how quickly time flies. It seemed like yesterday when we were both in primary... 
I didn't really have an age in my head.
idk
Wow.
Really?
Really? How old are you?
I just can't wait to drive! That is a huge upside for me.
Yep. That's true.
Haha. Thanks!
Oh. Never mind then.
Wow. That's a different perspective. Can I have a example?
Really?
Oh, I don't mind stress, but of course easier said than done.
such as?
Well. Thanks I guess
Anyways, sorry for the rant. Lool 
but also just because when people hear I'm younger than I look, they're like 'oh.'
everywhere D:
I see why they have restrictions and rules. They're just frustrating.
but its cool I guess
Yeah, you're right. You just have no rights whatsoever at my age...
Haha
Yeah it just can't come along quickly enough.
Oh well.
As in like age.
I gotta grow!
Pls
.__.

Omw
It's just the notes I took on the finals
Check out the wireframe I have in the folder lol
Well kinda
I already did lol
Are we just gonna use the Arnesen Pro case?
Under contention 1
It's basically the same as the one you guys had for nationals I just added some stuff from the con case at nsda finals
Can you check the con case?
I'm just aggregating everything we need into a folder
Did you get the folder I shared with you?
For debate?
Do you know what number we are?
I also gotta print some stuff out
Yeah
thank God*
That's the one I've been looking at in depth
Okay that god
Whitman's?
And who's case is it?

Did you use the right email?
Nope
Which pro case are we using?
Alright cool
I'm working on some additional stuff though but I can just print that out tomorrow
Sure
Yeah lol
Will do
Okay
Do you want to be speaker 1 or 2?
We should just talk some stuff over
What time will you be on tonight

I'm not gonna be at debate today
Yo
I don't know what I was thinking
oh shit you right
Today dammit
Todau
What'd we do in debate todau
...
I'm hip, I thought about starting Corey Coleman
Found Sam and Will's debate at this year's NSDA finals
And he wanted the captain's to be there
know*
So Friday during lunch I think he's having a session for new debaters going over the debate structure, timings and just other stuff beginners should knoe
My bad, was gonna reply to this earlier but forgot
rip
There's debate today too
Especially since Kubiak runs a run heavy offence
More of a reason to utilize him
Last season he was injured and had a slow start
CJ's gonna have a breakout year
He's my #1 back
What you mean
I wanna keep Anderson
Nahhhhh
honestly I feel like you lost :/
Makes a lot of logical sense hahaha
I thought you didn't do debate last year

Can you add me to the debate docs?
Do you know if we have another meeting tomorrow?

Yep
So you're definitely planning to do debate right?
that's a way to do it lol
Which are you going for?
Gotcha
let's pull some awards
fuck yeah
Or CE
I'm planning to double major CS / finance
Why do you wanna be captain lol
Not nearly as good as nationals but it's something
At my internship this summer, I spent the entire time pitching and listening to pitching so I've worked on my public speaking a decent amount
Good shit
Me too
Yeah scroll up fam
Are you still trying to do debate?
Classic Shane
You guys kicked me out of the old one smh 
I'm trying to talk trash
Is there a chat or something?
Y'all doing fantasy again?
Yeah

nice
I'm trying to go deep in playoffs
Lmao
like refine the shit out of my public speaking and logic
I'm just trying to get better during the summer
jesus christ

WTH
Got your email
I guess we can just find resolutions from this year and debate against each other haha
How can we practice our actual debating
I guess
huh
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
what
Idk how can we practice?
lol what's that
nothing at all?
Damn
Are there any good debate comepetitions during the summer
Sounds good
True
I heard that McKenna doesn't care if any of the seniors put debate team captain on their college resume :/
and you can easily poke a ton of holes in it if they don't really know what they're saying
People feel like they've hit the jackpot and stop actually doing their own research
Yeah
I hate when that happens
Holy shit
Nah what happened
There are some really good people in moco though
damn nice
Like I'm actually trying to go hard next year
True
You trying to be my partner?

Partly

Yeah, that's what I was afraid of
Do you have anything I could read or look at to prepare?
What are the major responsibilities of the special elections director?
Elections*
Is Special Election Competitive?
thought*
I also though about Chief of Staff but that's usually competitive as hell
I guess I'm still salty about a couple years back
I don't wanna get caught up in a shit ton of politics though
Yeah
Do you know who could be going for that this year?
For MCR this year you were the special elections director right?

I have a lot of work this week so...
What?

Concert?
Why not?
Yeah.
ikr
over 1,000 likes man

I think that this will be our biggest problem with Dahlia:https://www.facebook.com/GilbertBook
Yeah.
His lack of experience will show then.
He'll try.
If he does that'll be so hilarious.
idk haha.
 "Without new ideas, we do not innovate not improve our society. I feel that my "lack of experience" is more beneficial than not.
As I hold differing perspectives than anyone who has been a long standing member of the MCR."
This is what this Troy guy is messaging me...
None taken, my credentials are not very "pronounced" if you will. I have only basic SGA experience, however leaders are not founded from past experience.
They emerge as leaders, if you are a leader you can undertake something, in the spur of the moment. You don't need prior experience.
Incumbency is the greatest challenge to democracy, and innovation.
Alright can you give me the website URL?
Thanks man!
Ik.
I was going to write one to put on the website but what you wrote is really good!
Sure!
Who wrote that?
What.
I was like wtf
He also enjoys posting immature pictures on the "All Students in MCPS" facebook page...
lol
Apparently this guy is running for SMOB?
https://www.facebook.com/troyyamatotakemori
biased like shit
load of bs
how many people are running?
nom com?
wait?
damn
wtf
Maybe they could put it at a school where no one was running?
.__.
idk
RM?
Clarksburg?
yeah
couldn't
Could really find anything cheaper...
Just printed? 
So it's no engraved? 
OK it's one color right? 
Wait I'm kinda confused 
What do you mean by one for the text? 
Is it solid? 
What the design? 
OK. 
Or is it just as low as possible? 
What's the goal price? 
OK thanks
What are the main things we still need to do? 
More time to get ready
So we're pushing it back
Got it
OK so updates? 
What did you guys discuss? 
Oh OK 
Where? 
Yep
It amazing
It's great but can't you fade the audio at the end? 
Alright
How is it? 
Idk they sent out an email
Are you going to the annual December Executive Board Meeting 
Nice job
The old one is too cliche haha.
oh ok
what do you mean by motivational?
The ending animation is really nice though.
ok
Not behind Calvin
thinking*
I'm think plain white
The background is kinda sketchy bro. It's too distracting from calvin
Yeah.
haha ok
I mean I guess
it covers up calvin's voice
the music is too loud
yeah
I got you
Hey
No
Are you on BCC JV team? 
Alright cool
I'm not sure how to say it but I'd use the last one.
The first three are like Christina M.'s last time. Nice but not friendly. The last one looks nicer overall.
It just feels more friendly.
The last one seems the nicest.
What do you mean
is he good?
ok
who
yeah?
wristbands are really expensive
btw
I don't want us to run out 
but if we're going to get it professionally made we need a price range
yeah.
shipping is 10
2,000 stickers are 45
check that out
http://www.uprinting.com/cut-to-size-campaign-and-political-sticker-printing.html
3?
2,000?
1,000? 
how many stickers do you think we will need?
and justin only had 5 shirts I think
posters
logo + stickers + wristbands + shirts + poster have to equal 210
website is a must. $40
ok so
right*
You're rihgt
Oh yeah.
so we have an extra 30 for stickers?
$100 for logo
So we have like $130 left
that's $120 
$30 miscellaneous 
$40 website
$50 stickers
since
I'd say ~100 for the logo seems like a okay idea
how many months will the website be up?
$50 for stickers seems more than enough
Cause I'm trying to plan out an ideal amount to spend on the logo alone
btw can I have the website link?
?
yeah but does he have a idea of how many,where we're getting them and the cost
and does he have a plan for stickers?
hmm ok
yeah I know but how much has he already spent?
how much is calvin planning to spend?
wasn't there a grievance filed about that?
yeah i remember now
oh.
where did justin and get his done?
yeah sure 
but if company's aren't responding then I don't know
obviously
it's probably best to get a company to do it
nope
i don't know anyone that does logos and such D:
yeah ik what you mean 
in the campaign update calvin said that he's going to have the logo by next week right?
I honestly don't.
why?
hmmm?
Calvin told me he was asking a company to do it?
why?
haha
At the first MCR meeting of the year, you were wearing a brooks brothers polo. 
I just had a epiphany. 
Oh shit.
Probably. You?
Oh yeah.
yea
what do you mean?
no prob
he said he would be able to do it if we needed it by dec-jan
I know justin releaseed it in January 
when should we make the video by?
he says it depends when calvin needs it
probably but depends how busy he is
he hasn't responded...
when does calvin want the video?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3m3zESVmBY
https://www.youtube.com/user/DannyWelchvid?feature=watch
he's a junior
danny's pretty good at that stuff but he goes to churchill
https://www.facebook.com/danny.welch.583?fref=ts
since he's in humanities? 
not very many people. but shouldn't calvin know a lot of people?
hmmm.
as in video editing
But I'm the wrong person to ask for that stuff...
Yeah, I already talked to calvin and I'm supporting him. 
who did justin have?
yeah that's what I thought.
rachit
depends what
sure*
aure i guess
calvin and dahlia right?
this year?
Things like that aren't my specialty...
haha ummm
did you try windows movie maker?
kinda. I would ask rachit though
what?
I'm almost done.  
You got it. I'll return the edited copy soon.

I don't know.  Maybe sometime you,  Henry and I could have a Google hangout and discuss this. The problem with doing multiple locations is that if we don't have many people come to a venue then the franchise won't want to do a fundraiser with us in the future. 
Friday in November.
I was thinking about the fundraiser. We should probably do the fundraiser at Chipotle on a 
Hey take your time. 
Just email it to me when you're done.

good point.
and i can custom build too
I don't have that money lol
Haha.

HAha. Too funny
Nice. 
kinda...
I give up on that one
:'(
:'
ik. i don't know :
I don't know what they're looking for...
the keys are 1 word right?

I can't get it...
OMFG...
i can feel it.
Ahhh. It's right in front of me.
The link doesnt return anythingggg...
D:
Did you get password?
how do you move?
IT stops at begin run loop?
Woah. sweg
no way.
I mean emulator.
do you have a rom for that?
is that
wat
I'm so stuck...
Really?
AHHHHH. My decomplier sucks...
Really? Haha. I working on it also.
how is that even possible?
almost?
did you get the password 1?
python is pissing me off.
What is lyfe.
._______. derp.
how much was it?
do you have the full version?
I'm trying to use dede to decompile.
yep
I'm PHS DARK KIRBY
oh haha.
haha
Your grammar confuzzles me.
You wanted what to be?
what's your team name.
I did check the source haha.
ikr. I feel like the submit button doesn't return anything...
Yeah. Did you?
I got nothing.
How ya doing?
hmmm. when i run it it crashes...
Did you just open the program in python haha?
Which Crypto did you do?
Really? Thanks.
yeah...
Yeah same
Is the site down for you?\
I can't get the password one...
haha. how far have you gotten?
haha yeah
just a bit
The other stuff is a bit harder...
Haha. The Trivia is easy. Simple google searches. 
Like JUST signed up?
And its insanely hard...
We're in the middle of it.
what do you mean by happen already?
wait 
yeah
y
did you do ctf
Nice.
Really?
Blair does CSAW?
I don't know. I don't have a iPod or Phone so I don't really need it.
I just program. THATS IT.
We have our schools Wi-Fi password too. But I don't really know how.
'Hacked' or HACKED?
._.
With what?
Interesting...
Haha
Jk. We're buddies :D
Muhahaha. Yep.
Poolesville SMCS for da win.
We are no longer friends. 
>.<
Lol. Okay then. Where are you going for High School?
Hey Raphael! How's it been?
alright thanks
Yuga?
Suriya said it was Ms. Van Yugav
not now I'm just trying to figure out who to contact when we do
btw it's the individual year book pictures
we need the pictures for the website
just so I know
sure but season doesn't start until January lol
i'm just trying to figure out who the point of contact is
later on during the year could you send me the pictures of the people on the robotics team
Who's the head of the yearbook club?
Ok
Why?
Physics
gotchu!
It is though
And sorry for getting back to you so late :/
My wording's probably really bad so feel free to change anything/everything.
I'm still waiting on the computer team captain to get back to me about what he wants as the description for computer team. In SGA we organize various school events and are charged with raising money for our class. FIRST Technology Challenge (FTC) teams are generally smaller than FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC) teams and require a smaller budget. Both are very competitive and require a lot of dedication but FRC is just like FTC but on a larger scale.
I'll do it next period
Alright
Do you want a description of each?
Lmao
What's that?
Never heard of them
I have no idea what any of those are
Thats cool I'm eating too
Sorry :)
Ahahahahahaha
But i rather do that than ask someone I don't like
I'm gonna get soooo much shit for "being gay" for no asking someone
LEGIT
I think
Yeah
SK messaged me about this too
Its cool but I actually still have no idea what I want to do
Jesus
I always homecoming "proposals" are so cute
I'll figure it out
Haha yep
I really want to go though
Yeah
I've always thought you should go with someone you really like
Yeah
Not specifically tbh
But I'm so conflicted
I'd really prefer not to go alone
Idek
But if I don't have anyone I'm planning on going with
Yeah
So people are comfortable with it but I think it's kinda weird
Going with a friend
I never got that
Nah fam
Just in general
I actually want to go to hc but all the people I think are really attractive i don't talk to
Probably wont
Eh
What?
Aliciaaa
Thanks for the invite, I'd love to come!

I'm so glad I will never have to go back to that school again :D
xD.
Yep. 
Yo. My wannabe asian negro.
Hey! I haven't seen you in forever... How's it going?
alright thanks
What should I study for the physics test?
Yo
I fake being sick and then get hit with a cold like a mf
funny thing
yeah
Vikings are legit though
Like this man was about to cry
I'm not BSing though Eli got his heart snatched
Also I'm sorry for your loss
Isn't there a graphic organizer too?
When's our quiz on the Mediterranean for world?
Nobody
For what
accepted*
Should have accept that shit smh
You're welcome
You wanna cancel lol
What'd I miss in physics last week?
Where are youv
Literally standing here
At the main entrance
Here
Hurry up bruh
Where are you?
have*
Damn I should of worn my jacket
I'm about to be
Pls
I gotta put my bag in his car then

Yeah
You can pick it up or I'll just give it to you tongiht
Yeah, I'm not going
See ya tomorrow
Thanks
Please jesus
I'm gonna go to bed now
Okay thanks
but you know how they ask you to put down the colleges before the test?
I sent it to maryland already
So they get it the same time I do
She said I need it send it to them beforehand
but that would be the last one
The person from UMD who came in said it was fine
Like you know how you can submit scores online
but do I have to do it on the day of the test too?
for tomorrow's sat
I did it online
Nov 1
I'm not applying to anywhere EA
For Maryland I should send my score now right?
How am I supposed to give it to you lol
Kinda hard to describe
Like a pink flannel
It's pink lol
Idk personal pref
I'm just like ties better
I'm not gonna wear a bow tie tho
I only got 1
I'm just wondering
Know who is?
Are you at school right now?
I was just excited to watch him play
I mean yeah
smh
sh
Josh Gordon smg
Damnnnn son
Vincent
2-0 baby
I was prepping my debate case
SAT
I'm not going tomorrow
Good one
I'll probably wear a suit
Yeah probably
My b
when's the quiz?
Let me know if you figure it out
I thought it was tomorrow but I do remember him saying that he might push it back
I'm really hoping it's wednesday
shitttt
Is it due?
I left my entire physics notebook at school
What
Yeah probably
Still gonna dress up tho
Probably not
you're not going to pics for hoco right(
All my receivers are solid too
Then why are you doing it? 
This Chiefs defense is solid
which is solid
more like 20 touches
This man's been averaging nearly ~90 yards
Cause he hasn't gotten to the end zone yet
I got a two headed dragon at RB
I'll think about it
that's what I was trying to say
ily praneeth
youngin's and social media these day
ugh
fine I deleted it
Like tf
Was I supposed to use 9
what
I was just bumping your comment
?
Check out my last 3 retweets
That's too much
Hip
But Henry kinda made him seem like a bitch
I get that he doesn't want to escalate it
exactly
yeah he that was a dumbass tweet
Hit them the "let me know when you guys are the state champs of anything"
Justin could have actually destroyed everyone in that group chat
Yes
I'm deadass about to pull an all nighter
How are you studying for physics?
Sonnn
I'm stressed af
I gotta get a 100 on tomorrows
I have no idea how
I fucked up
bad
Did you do the practice thing that Hanson gave out?
I'll think about it
Damn
I don't need any WRs
I feel it coming
I'm waiting for that man to breakout
Idk
was that from michael?
saw it
Was it bad?
I fell asleep at like 4:30 last night studying physics
Think his name is Aneesh Acharya
If you do can you leave my mentee my email and let him know I'm not here today?
Are you going to the mentee meeting?
me*
rip to MN e
I don't know if he's testing on it though
It's in chapter 4
Centripetal force I think
Did Hanson say if circular motion was going to be on the quiz?
bruh
just ask him to marry you already
Shit that wasn't supposed to be a question mark
I don't remember?
Alright thanks
Do you know is it Conceptual or math
What's the quiz tomorrow on?
I skipped
What about for physics?
Do we have a test soon?
What did we do in world?
I'll get there around 9:30-10
Photo
I'm gonna do it in phori
Total distance is just the abs of displacement isn't it
I don't get it
Well I mean they're all just functions
Which problem?
What do you mean
Integrate
Yeah
Pretty sure that's a miswording
And therefore it's none of the above
So it can't be C either
I had to look this up but I believe a particle has a parabolic path when the only force acting on it is gravity
So we're down to C and E
It can't be D either cause velocity of the particle changes by 12m/s
It can't be B either cause time is never negative
Since the acceleration is 12 not 6, the answer can't be A
a=12
v=12t
x=6t^2
First thing I did was find the velocity and acceleration equations
Alright so which part
I gotta go downstairs and get my packet
Alright give me a sec
Oh the Physics packet?
Always lol
Oh yeah ofc
Ok
What
Pretty sure he said that he'd give em to ud
At least that's what he did for thermo and quantum
Nah but he usually pulls a decent amount of questions from there
Did you finish the Physics test review?
who would I ask though
and just showed up
that'd be awkward af if I'm not actually going w/ anyone from rm
I know a decent amount but I haven't seen them in bricks
going to rm hc would be kinda weird
nah fam
jisue?
who would you ask at rm
you're crazy if you think I'm gonna actually ask holly
why would I go to rm though
remember when you asked holly lmao
bruh
literally no one in that groupme is attractive
idk
nah fuck that
in world?
do you still have the picture that you took today?
estep and someone else
still not sure
how would you know, you weren't even there
wait
really
Just so you know there's a quiz in world either tomorrow to Wednesday
Lamar about to turn the corner
nah
Miss that man
Chandler Jones 
Np
And then it asks you stuff like the acceleration at specific times
So it asks you to find the equation of the velocity and acceleration obviously
Kinda
Yeah
It was all derivatives and plugging stuff in
I'm telling you
tuff
even with jimmy g down center
it's still about to be a close game
just wait
it's called depth boy
jamie collins is a top 5 lb in the nfl foh
no like shit boi
carson palmer is a chokejob
if we had brady and gronk, they'd be eating dust
bitch smd
both brady and gronk aren't playing
I already know
we taking the L tonight
either surround brady with beast ass recievers or give him a impenetrable o-line
See that's what the Patriots need to do
Eli has too many weapons
giants recievers are too nice
when you have that much time, someone's gonna get open
he's literally just standing there and throwing 0 pressure at all
Dak isn't even getting touched
this cowboys o line is just too much
Son
oops wrong emoji
or any pictures with you in it <3
i didn't like it either
true
what happened to your profile picture?
nice
How isn't it out of area?
are you gonna watch the giants game?
I think that's next Thursday
on chapter 3
Glenn's sister was being annoying af and yelling "put Ethan in"
and he's hurt too so Ethan will probably start next week
deadass
Cho split reps with Ethan Gaddis
Like 25
We didn't lose it because of him but he missed a field goal
not really
but idk it was pretty simple
It's supposed to
if you know how to do derivatives, you'll be fine
That thing was easy af
None lol
I don't think so
Bet 
Tell her I said thanks
Sure lol
I know we definitely have one tomorrow
Idk
Oh shit you right
Can you go Friday?
We beat them last year
Dude looks like he's straight from Africa
Attended
That's cause he attending the opening
Hopefully we beat them
We play them on the 30th?
That man is a junior 
Did you finish
Np
Those are better quality
Can you see that
Hold up
Yeah I got you
See ya
Oh true
Read?
I gotta do that worksheet tho fuck
I'm wrote down the equations and shit
Yeah
I thought about doing it to practice for the quiz but fuck it I'm sleeping
Yeah
Did you do the physics problems
Lmaooo
That shit was too funny
Open that alone
Do we have a physics quiz tomorrow?
Nah
Odell
Queue fucked up
I fixed it
Fixed smh
Fixedbsmh
I saw
On
I can't get ob
I really don't care for keepers though
I can't set them
Yesterday my brother practiced with some guy on dematha jv
Bruh
I'm hip that man is a monster
Nice
Near the flag
In the front
you up?
Tomorrow should be chill af
the worksheets have been pretty simple
Haven't really looked at Chapter 2 outside of class
?
Like the one right after labor day
Do you remember when Hanson said our next physics quiz was?
but on the other hand I'm really not feeling this outline
I mean he probably will but idk
Chilllll
For World, it says the outline for chapter 1's due tomorrow too
Nothing just asking
You saw the thing about wearing all black right?
yeah
I got a program due tomorrow for Stansbury
Today was a struggle
What do we need to know for world tomorrow?
Is our summer HW being graded for accuracy?
Cause the volume of the candy is to the 3rd power
I didn't do that rifht
So I converted mm to cm right?
I figured it out
I'm gonna check it again
I got 1.43kg/s but the answer is 1.43kg/minute
Not sure if that's right
Got ya thanks 
Justin's headass took my newnone
Is it the same chapters?
Hw?
He?
Do we have world he?
And I still have to do SRP
I know but I heard the class is hard af
why are you still up?
cause they want me to get a 4.0
My parents really want me to drop physics C :/
I'm not sure
I think so
I did the problem set but that's not due until thursday
nah
apparently
there was AP Physics C homework?
chill
montgomery kollege
#MKBound
Idk just navigate it I guess
:/
I'm gonna need some help, I haven't started yet
Damn that's intense
you putting in that work?
yeah sure

I've been trying to do some work on vacation lol
Wednesday
computer vision/imaging
it's called structure from motion
cs
I started pretty late so I'm going to have to work into the school year but I gotta talk to the SRP teachers and see if they'll accept it
I did a independent research project that I worked on by myself
I told Sekhsaria that I wasn't going to do SRP cause I didn't have a research internship but I figured it out
Thanks
Sure that's fine.
Hey can you send me all the stuff you've gotten this summer about SRP?
mba
or ce and then go back to get my MBa
I'm thinking either cs or finance
It's decent but nothing special
Might as well try lmaoo
I have a 3.6 so I really doubt I'll get into any except UMD and maybe USC
I kinda fucked myself over though
U Penn
USC
Georgia Tech
UMD
Olin College
Carnegie Mellon
UC Berkeley
What are you trying to major in?
You should yeah
You should get into AT LEAST a handful of those
Damn that's nice af

I'm not thinking of too much right now
I'm just curious
Where are you applying?
Wbu
Why?
No but I should

God damn
This dude just ruined his legacy forever
I'm done
Fuck this man
Nope
But I hope the report's wrong
Yeah I heard that too
Son Bos. Vs Cavs would be so nice
Easy road out
But it would ruin his name forever
Easiest for him to win a Championship if he goes to the Warriors
Best place for him
He should go to Boston
It's wayyy worse than LeBron going to the Heat
I swear if KD goes to the Warriors...
Lemme know when it's done
Is the competition between classes or in each class
Do you have no spaces lmao

The only thing is
I'm willing to go.
Ugh it's so far away though
When can you?
Not sure
Sorry, I just saw this
I think
Yeah
Uhhhh
I'm really bad at recalling tests
nah
yeah I think so
damn I think I got the first 2 wrong
Do you recall any other vocab?
Damn I just wish I remembered my vocab and math
yeah
wat
That's crazy
But how'd you find it that quickly
How do you know it was the same?
Really
Wtf
Wrf
So I wanna look at the test
But I don't remember all my answers
The tests not online
I'm trying to check my answers
Dude
Eyyy
The heart button
U a bitch
I just check facebook
Testing this shit
hopefully I won't have to
yeah
Yes
It's an AP
No
But definitely not all
I might have some
Are you taking it this year

it'd be wild
If they push the SAT back though
but yeah you could definitely do it
I don't think it's easy to self study for any course
but you really gotta put in work
Yeah
but those foams are wack
bred's are nice
lol
idkkkk
northern lights

I'm more worried about math tomrrow

I'm using the bathroom
Dude

Not yet
Legit like I'm watch our video and I'm like this is the most boring thing I've seen in my life
In the past 2 days
I feel like I've heard the words "sealing letters" a million times
cause I'm bout to go downstairs and make myself a grilled cheese
hop on google hangouts real quick
mr dennison talks about community impact
saying the same thing is another
thing*
emphasizing is one this
the last part we just say the same things over and over
give me reasons
why
plus we have no credits
but that's super important
a tiny bit
yes but then we have no space for feedback
well then what the fuck do i do
cause it's repetitive
I'm thinking about removing the conclusion altogether though
yes
5:55
yes
yes
But I'm trying to do it in fusion
I still have to take picture
No
yeah
I'll be pretty pissed if I don't
I better hope it does take me until 9
I can't give you a number
lmao yeah
I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to wear tomorrow
nah
definitely
storywise?
possibly
this niggas scared lmao
and he'll see it tomorrow
tell him to fuck off
cause sometimes that man has the wildest ideas
Make sure he doesn't fuck up the structure
why
what
yes
oh yeah
Alright
yes
I'm good
I'm going to make them
yeah
yeah
I'll go on the script
yeah sure
shit that wasn't supposed to be caps
YEAH
?
Should I add slides for each section
I can do it easy
that's my part
but it's still long
shorten the last part
can you
yeah
yeah
little less than 40
I mean Yes i did
Nah
What sentence
Yeah
nah
ight
I mean yeah but I'm eating
I took out the parts about the statistic cause it's not needed
yeah you're right
yeah
the export was a little weird
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3QaL-PAy-E&feature=youtu.beth
me, you'll see
trust
but we don't want this to be final
yeah
this version is more like "for your eyes only"
that's not on it yet
okay
yeah
?
?
so I'm not gonna send this in yet
but I wasn't sure what to put there
i has some parts when the screen is black
relax
a draft is uploading to youtube
forever
ok
no
ok
?
that's what I'm using
yeah
I just have the closing left
I had sahil rerecord something friday and I'm add it not
Jk
Forever
nah
oh yeah
negative?
but that makes it kinda jumpy
I know
and then a lot more sucking
then another good part
then everything else sucks
he gives us something good
like
All our feedback is in pieces
I think so
the feedback is a little choppy
not right now
honestly,
5 and a half
and balancing the audio
that's the easy part
I am
and Zach stole it to run from the cops
jackson left his car at jack's house or something
nah
https://twitter.com/J_Purdy97
Apparently Jackson had no idea and woke up with the cops at his door
if he got away
no idea
apparently he was going like 70 miles with 7 people in it
and drove drunk af
and zach was panicking and stole jackson purdy's car to run from the cops
and everyone was running
apparently the cops came
you know the party on friday?
jesus christ
did you hear what happened to zach?
our speaking
so that it stays consistent
I still have to balance the audio
let me download the audio, put it in the video and see it fit works
that's dope
yooo
I'm still looking for music
almost
It shouldn't be too difficult
as soon a possible
but
not asap
she just said please correct this and resubmit it asap
it was pretty melo
Cause I read what she said
not really
we need like slow piano music
I'm looking for it
Yes
Because it gives me flexibility
That's when it'll be up
Like right now
That's what I'm doing nigga
Ik
Cause it's just a summary of our paper right?
But that its going to be pretty easy
Yeah Ik
Probably ~12
But Im going to have it up before then
So as long as we fix it by tonight we'll be good
She doesn't work on weekends
Itll be up soon
In other words I'm on linux right now and I'll have to go on windows
It's on my Windows partition so I'll have to boot into that
Not yet
I went to bed at like 7 last night
Yo
I just got home
Yeah hold up
It's decent
Kinda
I guess
But I'm in a metro station right nkw
She said to do it soon
Nah
Yeah
When I get wifi
Alright

accepted*
apology accept lil bitch
3. hope you'd chill out
2. good
Because 1. I was asleep
stop waking up my family
now that that's resolved
she said okay
after she said the link wasn't working
and said that it'd be up by tomorrow morning
I already emailed Mrs. Garcia
you need to chill the fuck out
you panties are all twisted up
yes I do
annoy af
It'd be nice if you'd stop calling my house while my family is asleep
Jesus Christ
Son relax
We don't need it actually
It's fine
Nah I'm not giving it to him
Glenn called Praneeth.
No
That's what's preventing us from uploading
I'm sitting in english
What?
We talked about this
I know
Not finished but almost
Uhhhh
I have to present in that class tomorrow
Oh shit
Alright
When I'm done
yes
able to...?
in case I want to make some more changes
don't show anyone the video tomorrow
but you can't show anyone else the video
there will be a product rated 7/10 by 7
yes
but I may make other changes
done
well
yeah
that's fine I understand
I haven't finished cutting the audio yet
I need to add more scenes
I have all the audio uploaded
It
Cutting stuff
no
yeah
It's be done by tomorrow morning
this is an impossible task
no
I'm adding their feedback
all these cuts take forever
eh
click on the link
I changed it so it looks more legit before I finish
tiny.cc/sourceamerica
ok good
can you do it?
Try to view other people's files for me though
I am
I have to cut so much shit out
I'm trying
very very bad
that will be bad
If Mr. Lee does
Shit
cause I didn't
ask him
did sahil click on it
wtf
If anyone clicks on the link now
you realize how this works right
I'll try to finish our 10 minutes long video now
and tomorrow we'll rerecord it
refine the shit out of that
do it on the script
it's like a fucked or not meter
so I can tell if anyone's been on it
I just reset the meter
ok
tell sahil not to either
ok
DON'T CLICK IT
and files
videos?
can people view each others views now
bruh
17 clicks, 12 unique visits
I can track if anyone does
if you don't click on it
don't click on http://tiny.cc/sourceamerica anymore
they don't care
yes
Suriya
and she won
and she told me that she uploaded it late
I talked to Suriya
it'll be fine
why?
I did
I already did
makes it slightly more supicious
yeah
the text isn't a link
the word document
yours isn't even a link
boy
by the time we finish feedback and I talk about impact, that thing will be like 9
and it's already 6 minutes
I'm at the feedback part
I have no way to show it to you
only keep the super important parts
like a TON
start cutting shit out from the script
if you're done with the paper
Trying to figure that out now
no way
which they won't
IF the ask
but we can just tell them that it took a long time to upload
is the date on the youtube video is going to be 1/8/16
the only thing
yeah
in less than an hour, it's going to be switched to our video on youtube
so right now it's the coming soon
the youtube video
yeah
we'll be fine
as long as no one opens it
and I'll adjust it later
put what I had
eaiser said that done bruh
that's without the dennison part
like 8 minuttes
just the audio is too long
it's too long
guess what
no
I got the file
no
I'm gonna stop chatting
alright
lmao
what
got it
is he emailing glenn.r.phs@gmail.com?
tell him I still don't have it
i still don't have sahils
mayhbe
yet
just hasn't been yetr
and that's going to be linked to it
We're going to upload to youtube
Videos will be uploaded to an online video sharing site (YouTube.com, Vimeo.com, TeacherTube.com etc.) and the link to the video will be referenced in the paper or in a separate document.
until I finish
legit put that for now
our device
I don't have it
actually tell him to resend it
nevermind
tell sahil to resend our device
http://tiny.cc/sourceamerica
did sahil do our device part 1
I don't know if I'll be able to finish on time
I'm trying
idk man
yeah
what doe that mean in the script
We gave the employees 1 minute to seal as many envelopes.
it's still a link
who says
does it have to be a "youtube" link
I can't really give you a percentage
password123
https://www.egnyte.com/login/
yeah
That just allows me to update the video without dying
yeah
I'm still going to do everything I can to finish
yeah
but the video changes
so have a file with a URL that doesn't change
keep updating the video in the next day
same url
click it again
what's it say
click on it
http://tiny.cc/praneeth
I can use a shortener to change where it redirects to
If I put a URL into a doc right
I just realized something
yo
alright
that's still too fast
you talk way too fasst
you have the pdf of the dimensions right
going over 6 minutes
outside of not finishing
You know what the worst thing is
I'm organizing all the files so when I add it to the storyline I can find what I need
yep
Yeah
yeah
we have to
Yep
Can you write a general outline
Yeah
1 sec
I'm on my phone right now so I can't comment
Yeah
Cause I never actually show up
I meant that I speak it
At the end
Cause I'm the only person that doesn't show up in the video
I meant the concluding statement
Should I do impact?
Which section did you want me to read again?
Can't call right now
Message me
Why?
got on my computer
Bout to
You called me as I was taking off my shoes lel
I just got home
Which part are you recording

I missed the last bus
Waiting for me dad
Editting
Stop
Bus stopped
How's it going
I can*
I cant
Yeah
What do you mean

And we need more feedback like them saying our device is good
We need to test with as many people as we can
Let's meet in the R&D room @ lunch
Thats ok
He said he might not be here
Emailed dennison
Almost
We might have to split up to maximize time
I'll explain the plan in the car
Ite
Are his parents coming during lunch
I have the credit
I can uber
I have to go home and put in mad work
You guys can leave seperately
After Scott Key, I'm not going back to school
I already made a list of what we need
I spent the entire time writing the script
What time do they close again?
There's just nothing on the way there
We can probably Uber back
Yes I know
If it works for him
Alright
I don't want them to leave work on our account
Are you sure
Dammit
Idk how
We have to gooo
Poolesville is a fucking pain in the ass
Yeah
I've been requesting for the past hour boy
They have to accept it
Yeah but that's not how it works
It's quiet as shir
I can't talk on the phone dumbass
Where are you?
Idk
None available
Yeah
It's cause we're in fucking Poolesville
But no ones picking it up
I'm requesting an uber
After 3rd
Im in english
Karl doesn't come until the last fucking second
Outside the R&D room
Don't forget the epoxy
Good
If you see this, try to wear a dress shirt tomorrow
check the pdf
tomorrow is going to be a wild day
we gotta pick up the paper from Mr. Lee and ask him what changes we need to make
true
some of the paragraphs start the same line as the title and some are on the next line
we just need to make sure that shit is on point
ight
have you read this?
http://www.sourceamerica.org/workforce-and-research-programs/design-challenge/design-challenge-high-school/high-school-requirements/high-school-paper-requirements
ight
Can you work on the paper?
like <$2
hopefully the price of the device is SUPER low
BTW
why aren't the titles on their own line for the paper?
ask him
I don't think he has a card
is he still awake
I found a 22 off one
how much did it cost w/ 20 off
I've never used uber before
The promotion
free on the way there and I'll pay on the way back
uber
uber
and let it dry until 3rd
We can do it before 1st
he'll give it to us tomorrow morning
nah
like definitely
he said he is
so water doesn't come out
the sponge
we need to epoxy it tomorrow morning
After Karl prints it tonight
will that be enough?
3 hours?
to dry
how long does it take?
epoxy*
can you bring in expoxy tomorrow?
Round 2 Deliverables
http://www.sourceamerica.org/workforce-and-research-programs/design-challenge/design-challenge-high-school/high-school-requirements
We also need a summary
I don't think we have anything else right
yeah
I'm completely done modeling though
not yet...
We reinforced it so it probably won't crack
CGarcia@sourceamerica.org
yeah
Karl's going to print it
it's nice
we might want to site them in the text
ok
Why'd you take out the refrences
why?
yeah why
I just accepted the call
invited*
I invite you to chat on gmail
can you hear me
like stuff to guide them
I feel like we should have more directions
Idk
I'll try it
to put in the video
of how we came up with the idea
we need to find a "inspiration"
in the video and in the paper
and different angles
just insteead of a shoe it'll be our device
I want something like this
hopefully I can find a sponge print
I'm just not supersure how to model it
I know what to do
I'll try
uhh sure
I'm not sure how to do it but we need it
yeah
That's the plan
yeah
and in our demonstration, we'll have to fill it with water
do we have another sponge
cause allen needs it
oh wait never mind
do we need a lid
like that
give me 2 minutes
I'll do it and show you
no idea
I'm thinking about adding walls to the flat portion
and then have karl print it
I'm asking cause I can add anything right now to the model
cause the duct tape is just too rachet
how are we going to say we attached it to the table?
Yeah
I rounded the corners and made them thicker
I've been making it more stable
yeah
karl's gonna print us another one
I'm editing it
cause I'm probably gonna be messaging you a lot
Can you leave fb chat open
yeah
pls
yooo
make a list
amazing*
but it's really touching and amazin
you never expect stuff like that to happen
that's just so crazy to me
study hall
she was really appreciative and said that what we were doing was wonderful
I know
and said she knew people who worked at scott key
and she was so nice and thanked me
and described what we're doing for SourceAmerica to her
I tell her that I worked at Scott Key
and how he works at this place called CSS to shred paper
How they use an iOS app to communicate since he's unable to speak
and she talks about her son
apparently she has a son with a disability
"I'm don't want to be nosy or anything but what are you working on"
and this lady next to me taps me on the shoulder and says
Look at and editing the footage
I was sitting in Starbucks right
something crazy just happened
Dude
It throws everything off
I know
there's no way that I'm going to use vertical footage in the video
maybe
but vertical looks so bad in a video dude
sure I'll take anything
yeah sure
cause facebook compressed them
they get messed up messenger
email me the pics
I need pictures dude
we still need some more footage of them giving us feedback
yo
which email did you send it to
Nope
I'm going through everything I have again now
that we took @ scott key
can you email me all the pictures you have on your phone?
like which do you prefer
morning or afternoon
alright
you never answered what time
yeah
What time do you want to go to Scott Key
Apparently it keeps collapsing on itself
The corners are too thin
It's the wrong format
I can't edit the STL
The Azeem to send me the original CAD files
Oops
Tell Azeem to send me the original sti files
I need to get the model so I can modify it
The model is fucked up
No
Who CAD'ed it again?

We still might go to npo
Not sure yet

How come?
Alright then
That was kinda random
Okay?
Idk actually
Nah
I kinda want them to make the playoffs though so they can get killed by the Vikings.
They've been stealing these games cause their opponents have just been making unlucky mistakes
They still play the Cardinals next week
Whatever dude
I hate Chip Kelly too cause that man is a idiot
I know*
I knew e
So the redskins can take over 1st
I need the eagles to lose
Or I should cause he hasn't entered the grade for the last article summary
I have a 89.4
Lmao
You can look at my notes on the bottom
Can you do the others?
I got part a and b basically done
Alright
i completely forgot
also when you see this, can you rewatch the video of the employee with one hand and identify what problems he had?
What did Mr. Lee say to do if we don't have any data?
Yeah
Haha same
that shit was nasty
Did you see Gary Payton's dunk?
yep
yeah
I'll get some stuff ready
Just gotta sell our project
PAPER AND VIDEO
Yeah for sure
They don't actually do anything
A lot of the other projects are way too dumb
Exactly
If we have a good paper and video, we have a chance
Ryan and Brandon were both finalists so honestly
Whatever
I'll also have to explain how we disappeared off the face of this earth for like 2 months lmao
I will
They were both super simple as well
You remember ryan chos and brandons right
I think it might just come down to our paper and having a bomb ass video
THINK about it though
Idk either dude
Kent
Who are you presiding for?
I literally just finished a SGA meeting at starbucks where we wrote the talent show script
If we 3D model it maybe
Yeah
And model it anyways
I'll probably go buy epoxy
I might just model it tonight
Not if we 3D model it
I might make a 3D model
Undecided
What
I can't come
Nah
Creed starts at 7:20
I honestly rather watch creed
bruh
the movie starts at 7:20
Where are you guys going?
Ishan?
Who's going?
If I come it'll be kinda last minute
Idk
My moms been going on my life all day

I mean I got small hands but
its pretty big
yeah probably
from Hershey
Don't you have small balls
Forgot I had this
It's a different type of monster
He's just so big which was why he was able to get it
Its about positioning and reading the ball
Dez
That's vintage dex
Odell would never be able to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrQCX0kC37Q
but this is some other type shit
I get people who say that Odell is a beast
dude
probably cut out heads
we're not sure what to do
cause you were on jv boy
obviously nigga
zach wanted to know
Games
When does basketball season start
O yeah that's 2XL
What size glove does he wear
Just doing my thing cuh
squashed the beef
Except with you
I'm not one to start beef on twitter
Idk
Like this is high school, she'll be a fucking loser in 5 years
She's not worth shit
Not*
Cause I know she's no gonna amount to shit
I'm not trying to beef on Twitter
I thought about just favoriting it
That's savage
Son

SON

Yeah thursday doesn't work for
We need to have a working prototype
what are we doing
About Scott Key then
easily
let's not forget Tom Brady has 1 interception which should be 0
http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/passingYards
I can guarantee you that he won't pass for only 77 yards
??
nicer than Tom Brady
not like mr. rodgers himself the 77 yard legend
brady produces EVERY WEEK
that was a fluke game and you know it
Bruh
don't stretch it
you get the idea
like odell
we gotta produce
Cause we haven't talked to them in like a month nigga
I'll go we're just going to need a prototype by then
Why
lmao
yeah
not friends with her on snapchat
Nah
Everyone was like fuck that
Nah
Anyone
They kept trying to get people to go into the closet with them
I just remembered
Son
True
Im ready

Alison knows how hot she is
honestly she could have been the bigger person and not responded but hey, this is high school
Alison thinks she's completely right though
Joe is wonderful
I actually kinda feel bad for heather tho
that's too funny
bruhh ahahahah
and talk about alison's twitcon
can we step back for a moment
held nothing back
damn
cause we wanted to use our lesson to guide the presentation instead of the other way around
ours it pretty short
it's a school presentation so nah
when we highlighted the passage, it looked fine on my computer but on the board the contrast was messed up so I'd recommend you underline and stuff
so if I went back and changed it, it'd use more pictures, make a conclusion slide and remove the highlights
I shared it with your mcps account
ours was really crusty but I'll tell you all the things I would change
do you still want it
Bruh you're not even going to school
We don't do that
I'm doing homework
I mean who's going
Are you going?
that's really solid
good job anyways
you should have gotten that 2400 though
I know you studied hard as shit but it makes other people feel bad
son relax
congrats man!
I saw
lmao nah
are you going to the game?
what are you doing tomorrow?
A lot of people go there to lift but I ain't about that life
It's small though just two hoops
Yeah
All I really do it "play basketball" and shower
Huh I just realized that I'm old enough to lift there now
I just kinda go whenever
Parents*
Sports and health, my parent bought a family plan a long time ago and they go everyday
But my "researcher" is kinda sketchy
I have a lot of it done
Sorry I was at the gym
Not the MCPS one?
but I can't make a folder
how
I'd get a Edelman on but Brady is so timeless
I need to get a brady jersey asap
nah
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B92EH6C3DJeINm1uU3ZXWk83eG8
it's mr. curran's folder
I asked rachel and she sent me the link to something that I only have viewing permissions to
Like wtf
I literally don't know where to make a folder
These look like yeezys
over a thousand
I want these so bad
https://undefeated.com/footwear/low/adidas-tubular-runner-primeknit-grey
my parent's might not want to drive us
I don't know
If you want sure
like who
maybe
A lot of my elementary school friends go there but historically I'm pretty anti rm haha
Not a huge fan of him now but I'd still root for him
Yeah
I actually hate their team
I don't want to support RM tho
it's dumb
you have no idea how much I want to sit with RM
me too
bruh*
burh
and we don't even go to clarksburg
cause we fucked them up
as*
we'd just look dumb a shit
not that I'm afraid of them
and we would get fucking flamed
RM's students actually go to their home games
yeah proably
sit*
that was where the RM parents are supposed to say
we actually weren't supposed to sit there
Cause we were being stupid
yeah
I mean at least you went to middle school with clarksburg kids
Like we don't go to either of the schools and we're sitting with rm
cause its strange
eshwar has hope
aquille carr got signed to the rockets
btw
if I do
I'm not sitting with rm though
that's cause we were talking shit and they lost ahaha
why would I go though
and yash
is will coming out
maybe
hmmm
it says it's at rm
lmao
http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/richard-montgomery-rockets-(rockville,md)/football/schedule.htm
and honestly I don't care if RM or Clarksburg wins
like who
I don't know anybody except will though
where is it
but I heard they're mostly a running team
RM's quarterback is a sophomore
how'd cho play
like straight up dropped?
colin mannnn
jesus
What do you mean?
Damn that's NFL legend
How far was the field-goal
Poolesville step up
JESUS
Ugh
Fuck

what's going on
this fucking blows
my parents don't want me to
Bruh you have no idea how badly I want us to beat RM
Could you keep me updated to what's going on during the game?
Yo could you do me a favor?

I'll try when they get home
sick enough not to come to school

Yeah this is gonna be tough 
My parent want me to get national merit so I gotta study for psat

This is too much
I heard we got a math test

Or I was
I'm sick
the man literally looks like something out of a horror movie
Son is it just me or does this guy look like a clown
Cowboys are gonna win the division
You're 1-2 boy
Giants won't even make the playoffs lmaoo
Let's go Thursday
I'm not trying to do that
No way

Trippy
Force touch is actually so triply
I'm loving this it's dope
Nice
Yeah it's nicer
Hi
??
what
nobody specifically
I'd much rather go with someone that I do
how does that make sense
what
I don't like her like that anymore
when
Really?
But everyone I thinks hot I don't talk to
I wanna ask someome
Go get em man
That is kinda strange
Oh huh
What do you mean?
Yeah
Like "Do you want to go to homecoming with me"
But don't ASK her
Ask about the situation
That's lame
Don't ask over messenger man
Yeah
Ask her if shes interested without actually asking her
Are you still asking jisue
Yeah
Payne
I think Michael added me
Which one
Fuck you
Nigga
Why
What 
I'm pretty siced
Or its supposed to
It comes tomorrow
I did
Yeah
And I only take dubs
I thought about getting rose gold but its bronze
In*
Actually I saw SK with if in middle school I think
I actually house it and I remembered that you had it too
Phone case twins?
It's k
Not really
And that's so stupid
Doesn't matter
I'm not blind
It doesn't matter
We have different tastes
Not even a little bit
I honestly don't find her attractive
Nah
Its not there
No
My main man skip bayless
I'm watching first take
No nigga
I told her it was a joke
I'm in the living room with my dad
She said she could lowkey tell
And she told me that jisue don't wanna go anymore
I told her
I heard you wanna email before winter break cause afterwards its a riot
I'm starting to look around for internships
idk i just have work to do and don't feel like doing it right now
supp nigga
You don't do that man
I haven't talked to any of them in years.
Depends
Eh
It doesn't make sense
Lol
I knew them when they were like 10
But that's now
But I haven't talk to any of them in years
I know people at RM
Nah that doesn't matter
...
I dont
I don't wanna go with someone I'm not attracted to
Sarah?
I don't like them like that
Yeah
I'm not like
It's ain't like that
So...
And I'm not asking someone
I won't go to RM without asking someone
Like 
I mean
(Probably)
You'll have a bomb ass time
Go ahead man
If jisue wants to go
Yo
But that's kinda the point of homecoming
Person dammit
Persob
Like you should be even slightly attrached to the other persob
I always thought going as a friend was dumb
And again I don't know anyone at rm
But none of the people I hang around with I'd want to go with
I kinda want to go
That's just strange
I'm not gonna ask someone I don't knoe
I thought all the IB kids were anti homecoming
Wait
I probably won't even ask anyone to Poolesville hc
Exactly
None
Not of the IB kids boy
Not sure
I'm DEFINITELY not trying to do that
I'd have to ask someone from RM though
True
Idk
I see... Uhhh
Or jisue..
So she basically asked you to go to homecoming with her
Lol
I just think it'd be awk af
Like if you're going to go at least ask someone
Alone
Would you go to another schools homecoming alon
Why the fuck
Nigga
Jk idk
I see you
Kayy
Sure go ahead
What are those
:)

You wanna study together during study hall tomorrow?
Yeah
I heard he got carried by Dennis Levin tho
so I actually know wtf to write
just so I can see em
I'm trying to ask people for their papers
yep

we want a simple product that can be mass produced
brandon told me that marketability is super super important
yeah
what do you mean
Wtf
Who?
I'm in a SGA meeting
But they had a form
I couldn't find a email
So on some websites
I listed them out based on the spreadsheet
Today's just writing that we contacted a bunch of npos
did you do the research
yeah
how you found an article yet
true idk
I could have sworn he said that he was collecting them tomorrow
lee said he was collecting journals though
thats my article
https://www.google.com/patents/US7072890
I'll probably take the one in January since I'm not prepared for the upcoming one
I'm gonna do it tonight
idk
what are you talking about?
Lets see if we can find some more npos
Just cause its kinda confusing once we've contacted a lot of people
Alright cool
Did you see the spreadsheet I shared with you?
But sure
I left a message
We already did
We're making groups tomorrow
Source?
I got it

glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
alright cool
pls
hmu
how much of the math packet did you finish?
Praneeth missed a call from Glenn.
How much you write?
I got all my examples tho
Nah
You know how Huck has like a conflict cause he's helping Jim escape
Oh just say something like 
Which part
For what
Odell probably won't put up the same numbers he did last year though
But that's what Revis is so good at doing
Yeah it was sick
And defensive players can really fuck you up
Odell needs to be careful though cause a lot of players are kinda sick/jealous of him
Revis was just chilling
And Odell just hits him hard
Odell was running out of bounds so Revis was like okay and does the little push thing that dbs do
Lmao
I already wrote a plan for that one
I'm good
But I really want to have it off my chest
So I'll probably work for a long time tonight
Just got home
I shared the Huck Finn doc with you
Nah but I really don't wanna go back to school on monday
but I'm going to my parent's friend's house at like 6
I wanna have it done by today so I can focus on other stuff tomorrow
yeah sure
Or nah cause it don't exist
I heard thats rough
Oof
Who do you have?
just shows what a dick he is
daisy knows that tom has a mistress but the second tom thinks that there's something going on between daisy and gatsby, he gets all pissed off
np
its actually kinda funny
Yeah
but its a strong indication
It doesn't explicitly tell you that daisy knows
or something like that
she looks at her daughter and she says "I hope she grows up to be a fool since that's the best thing a girl can grow up to be. A fool"
During the party at their house in the very beginning of the book
Yeah
wtf
tackles*
he just sheds drinks like they're nothing

Jkjk 
I h8 u
3
It hasn't changed
Same thing
She's usually pretty chill
Im not trying to full out flame her
Well alison lit every one up
And its kinda my fault for the phrasing since I could see how it could come off the wrong way
And she said I was being judgemental and I kinda was
I said that if you're drinking your not thinking about your future and think its worth that much to you
But I kinda care that some people don't do dumb stuff
They thought others were jealous they weren't invite d
Just in general
And I'd really rather not see that happen to some of those people there
I don't care they're going to parties but drinking can really fuck your life up
Nah my tweet was 
But they were like police are so dumb blah blah blah
Both
And idiots were proud af and bragging about it on social media
And did an alcohol test on them and they all passed
And the cops showed up
Well some of them anyway
And the people who went were dumbasses
But Zach told me it sucked
Idk
I didn't get invited to and had no idea about
So apparently there was this party
I was talking to man dad chilllll
Sorry boy
Lmao
Sophia
Nah
Haha
Lebronnnn
Ight
Why

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

He's a great pokemon
As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB. Thanks!

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

actually use this:
In todays world, technology is an essential part of our lives. From the large clunky desktops under our desks to the sleek minicomputers in our pocket, its almost impossible to imagine our lives without them. At first glance they appear to be magic, but these advancements did not just appear out of thin air. They are products of the hard work and inventions of thousands of years of innovators. Out of all the men and women, who have and had dedicated their life to contributing to mankind, there is one that jumps out at me; Steve Jobs. Steven Paul Jobs served as the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Apple Inc. and is widely regarded as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer and smartphone industry. His ability to embrace failure yet stay focused while aiming for simplicity made him a very successful and admirable businessman.

._____________________________________________________________________.
woahh. I go there too.
what gym?

yo
Katie.
Ok\
Ohh.
......................................................................................................
Oh yeah D:
Did we have any math homework?
-1/11
the worksheet?
3.1a?
number 3 on what?

for what
Whattt.
What did we do in English today?
What.
What homework did we have today?
good night
i guess
ugh
Except I have retarded numbers
Ahhh. Isn't nice
over-powered
Katie has OP numbers.
My life isn't fair tho

Stalker.
A.
What.

xD
Seems legit
I'm crying to myself right now
FUCK
I have 8/9ths.
WHATT?
your slant asymptote
What's your fraction for #4?
Math is a biatch.
Agh.
:D
thanks
not*
no really
I can't find mine. ._.
Oh yeah.
number 2?
What was our English HW?
R&E HW?
No, an angle cannot have a negative measure.
what about history?
Did we have any english hw?
Im so regretting not going to hc
yeah
i think
24 - 30
yeah :D
buttons wise
what do we press
x=a
It gives me a syntax error.
What?
How do you not round on the Math HW again?
Still working? 
Haha.  Np
Well you need to think about it like this. Let's take 25 for example.  When you find the square root of a number you are finding the midpoint of the factors. The square root of 25 is 5 and anything greater than the 5 is a repeat. 
Pretty sure yeah. 
 Mmmm. I just finished studying for math. Do you need help for comp Sci? 
Okay. Why are you still up? 
How do you hold papers though?
What kind of notebook do you use?
Wat.
No prob. What's tomorrow's physics test on?
I think so
I'm not done yet
yep

ummm. 5s then
or note 3
wait note 2 
I love my phone. I just feel that the 5s and note ii are a bit better.
I'd pick either note ii or the 5s.
Haha. Why?
Comp Sci Hw?
Did you find the answers to the Physics HW?
Yeah.
English HW?
Your 2nd fact is good. 
Your first fact is a repetition. Sorry! 
How can you see the facts of other people? 
We don't do that. 
Jk. 
And we'll laugh at you. 
Besides Matt and I. 
Just add it. 
The test is Friday right? 
Same.  I still have a bit of math. 
No problem. Are you done with homework? 
Haha. Ishan asked the same thing. We'd prefer that you enter them individually. 
When in doubt, just have it ready.
I'm not sure. 
Thanks. 
Ahh. I see. 
How in the world... 
Did you do the expression tree for the If statement? 
Did you do PIP #3?
No problem. 
does it work?
var1 = int (input ('Enter your first number'))
Yes?
The essay is due tomorrow right? 
Did you figure out when it is due? 
idk either
Where's that problem? 
I think so. 
OMG I'm sorry.  I'm pretty sure Jessica has it. 
Oh. I'm so sorry! I've been kinda jet lagged.
Oh haha.  OK.  I was thinking of the problem in the wrong way. Thanks. 
Stupid phone.
UGH. I keep trying to screen shot it.
Hold on can you resend it?
Really? I snapchated you the diagram I drew for the problem. Does yours look similar?
AGH. Did you get the last 2 problems on the math sheet?
I'm eating dinner. I got home and slept for 3 hours. Bad idea. 
Are you done with homework? 
Thanks! 
Do we have any history homework? 
Yeppp. It does. Well.  I gtg. Talk to you later. 
Didn't hear a word she said... 
The last day of school I didn't sleep at all. So while Ms. Bradshaw was introducing herself to me, I was pretty much asleep... 
Haha. That's my daily routine. Without coffee I die.  
I'm missed a Hot Chelle Rae concert because of the Science... 
Must finish science haha.  
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. 
Why are you in VA? 
You? 
Yeah. 
Maybe. 
:D they're going to be very confused... 
Haha. That's me. I'm going to HAVE to do that if I want anyone to vote for me... 
What person? 
Haha.  It's the beginning of the year.  It's supposed to be like that. 
Hmm.  How come? 
Kinda. 
Ok cool.  
Ok thanks!

Never read it.
Jonathan Swift.
I was going to do it on Game of Thrones tho.
Same was Gulliver's Travels.
Ugh*
Uhh.
How was that?

It's good.
Gulliver's Travels.
Muhaha.
I've been awesoming all over the place.
It probably has tons and tons of preservatives. 
Yeah. It's too perfect.
His hair is usually teal.

I just realized that your brother looks a lot like Daesung from Big Bang.
Oh. I love this stuff.

The Science?

Haha. Noob. 
Insane password. 
And I tried to make my Gmail hack proof. 
I kinda feel that your brother was exaggerating... 
Well.  Gmail. 
I called Google and deleted the email. 
I had my email hacked once too. 
D:
Your email was hacked? 
Couch potatoes. 
Ask and 'bother' as much as you want.

Oops. Wrong one.
Yesss?
Lol.
Auto correct. 
Look.
I love sneakers and stickers too.
Which one am i ?
In the beginning it'll feel a bit awkward if you didn't go to Clemente but everyone becomes a big family :D
You'll be fine. Trust me. It won't really matter.
We're all pretty much starting on equal ground. 
Don't be we just work hard. As long as you work just as hard you'll be fine. Our middle school teachers we're a bit harder on us so we're somewhat more prepared. But it won't matter. 
I'm both excited and terrified to be moving on to a different section of life. But change is good. 
Yeah. 3 weeks. I'm not sure how to feel about that...
I got to shoot rifles and shotguns tho.
Pretty much. Yeah.
._.
No.
Let me put it this way. The camp had no indoor plumbing besides showers...
Kinda. 
Yepppp.
^.^
Panda*
Indeed. Silly rabbit. 
I'm a magic panda trainer ;D
Lol. 
You're just too popular. Everybody loves you.
;) You know it.
Yep. We're besties.
D:
That's kinda stupid...yayyy. We're panda buddies. 
Really? Uhh. When?
OK. Then what so I get to be? :D
So are you a panda?
That's kinda strange...
OK
Uhhh.
Oh then. -.-
I'm not sure what that means...
Oh coolios. 
Sooo *
Yep. I don't really know him solo.
Yeah?
Eamon's going to humanities. 
Oh sorry. I was packing. What?
NP.
First I would do have and later if you're feeling up for it then you can do them all.
Well. I took 50% of the notes on each link.
Indeed.
Dang. Too much swag.
Yep. Be jelly.
Magic.
Yay!
If you press the power and homescreen button at the same time it should work.
See. Skillz. Do you know how to take a screenshot?
http://images.mobilefun.co.uk/graphics/productgalleries/38668/speck-candyshell-case-for-samsung-galaxy-s4-white-slate-p38668-a.jpg
You mean plastic?
Oh the candyshell?
Incipio.
Yeah... Shattered screens are not fun... I have a case on mine too. It's just not very bulky. 
It's pretty good. The phone is made of aluminum so it feels super smexy.
Haha. I was deciding between the HTC One and the S4 and I got the One. We could have twinned D:
Nom Nom Nom. Some you'll have to show me all the cool features the S4 has.
Yes you are.
See all most people get iPhone because it's a hipster phone. But Androids are as hipster as it gets.
Yeah. You're starting to embrace your SMCS self. Android <3
Oh nice. Why didn't you get 5
Which iPhone did you have?
Like a panda case?
Yepp. I know. ^-^
Pandas.
Lol. 
9
I*
Yeah a have a younger brother.
Lol. That's okay. I'm the tallest person in my family... My family's pretty short too.
Lol. How tall is your brother?
Hehe. Thanks! How tall are you?
Yeahhh!
1999
Yeppp!
Cool! You're 10 days younger than me ^.^
On*
 Yepp. Wait your birthday is in the 17th right?
Naah. It's OK I did too. Haha.
I'll either walk home or go there. 
Hmmm. The library. 
Yeppp. Where are you getting off at?
Haha. I think we're on the same bus on the way home. :D
Really? I might ride the QO bus stop sometimes. Like 25 minutes.
Lol. What bus are you going to ride?
At*
I see him a the QO library.
Brown Station.
Da gh3tto.
Not really... Friend. Glenn. Ehhhhh.
Glenn is not being a nice person and is telling the truth. But if Katie ever needs anything she can just ask. 
Katie Cho is being a silly girl since she has nothing to worry about.
Jk. Katie Cho is a genius.
I'm a genius dudeee. 
Really? Good guess lol. Most people can't guess correctly. And you're Korean????
Yeah why?
Ok cool. 
Awwww. You go to a Catholic church right? 
Sometimes. I'm not very religious though. 
Cooliossss. Are you very active within your church? 
Where are you guys going? 
Okie Dokie. Do you have anything planned this week? 
Yeppp.  Sorry! 
Oh ok.  I got you.  Btdubs from this Sunday to next Sunday I'll be out since I'm going to a sleep away camp. Meaning no cellphone :'(
Like the stuff on the test that we took today? 
Uhhh, sure! Can you give me the problems right now so that I can have a idea of what it is? Cause I'm gonna be a tad bit busy tomorrow D: 
Me ice skating = me falling on my face xD
Hey don't worry about it. How was ice skating? 
And where do you have to go to lose service? Lol. 
Ugh.  That sounds hard to balance D: 
I'm decent but the PHS basketball team is actually pretty hard to make... You? 
I wish. xD
Yeah. I'm ok I guess. 
Oh sorry I was playing basketball.  Ummmm no I did 8 of the 16 sections. 
Thankss Katie! Are you doing the Science Hw right now? 
Kk. Thanks. :D
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
Lol.  Could you forward the email to me? 
Her instructions are pretty confusing... 
Do you need help? 
Oh yeah.  I did the notes.  I just remembered that I didn't finish the questions... Thanks! 
Yeah I'm done.  Just do the things that you don't know for the math packet. The packet won't be collected. You just need to know the information in case you get a quiz. 
Lol. 
Idk. How was the nap? 
:(
Heyyy. I'm sorry. I was still at Poolesville so I didn't have my charger. 
My phones about to die... :'(
Your phone
What's your number? 
http://www.snapchat.com/glennren
Too much swag. 
:D that's more like it. 
You need to be more confident in yourself... 
How original. 
Do your have a snap chat? 
Just too much swag. 
What a boss. :) 
Wattt
I like the s4 better. I have the HTC One if you know what that is. 
Jk.  The s4 is cool. 
Oh just asking.  I judge people. 
And hey.  Just a question.  What phone do you have? 
Awww. 
And why? 
http://www.tetrisfriends.com/users/profile.php?id=1560978
Lol.  Wrong person xD
You have to go to marathon, and then Region Md
http://www.tetrisfriends.com/leaderboard/index.php
Yeah... I'm 33rd in MD :D 
He can't. I'm too good. 
Haha.  He was trying to beat me at tetris
Library. xD
Yeah
Matchinggggg :D lol 
Awwww. That's cuteeee. 
Muhahaha.  How? 
:'(
What? How come? 
._. 
Yep that's the time! Haha. 
And sports. 
Yeah. It's a hour.  All the other kids have to wait for us before they start clubs. 
No problem :D
Uhhh.  Your welcome.  But if you need any help during the school year especially in computer science, I'll try my best to help! 
What I can would do is focus on PHS but continue music as a side project. Keep practicing though :D
But it's always better to do music. 
I didn't have time D: 
And I used to play violin sooooo. 
I listen to classical music. Well kinda.  Stuff like Lindsey Stirling.  
What? o.O
What's that supposed to mean? 
I don't think so. 
It was a compliment.  Lol
You're being modest. 
Uh huh. 
Uh huh. 
Oh yeah. You're really good at Guitar right? 
Years*
Hey you never know. Maybe at this time in 4 year you'll be packing for Harvard. :D
No you're not. 
Really? D: Well.  If you need anything just ask. K.
I'm sorry.  Haha.  But really.  Couldn't you ask your brother or something? 
:P
Katie.  Shut up. 
No problem! I'm not a even that good at math. Lol
Nah.  Don't worry ;D.  They can't. 
Yeah
Parts*
Magnet PreCal has 2 part AB and BC. You take AB freshman year and BC sophomore year. AB is really just algebra 2. I'll be in AB next year. 
What about it? 
I'm not going to functions either
Mmmm.  It's ok! That was just a test for them to test what math to put you in.  
Lol.  Did studying pay off? 
Really? :( How come? 
How was the test? 
Alright! See you tomorrow! Btdubs.  I followed you on instagram.
Too bad.  Katie is cooler. End of discussion. 
Don't be ridiculous. Katie is so cool that she can freeze Glenn's coolness. 
Ikr.  Maybe Katie should be the supreme leader. 
And I'm Glenn's sidekick, Katie.  I use my army of pandas and unicorns to crush my enemies. 
I'm*
So I your sidekick?._. Lol. 
Dem words r missin letters. 
I'm sure you will. Uh oh. We got a badass over here. 
Thanks! But you too :D
Both.  
I'm working on SGA stuff but I'm probably going to take a shower soon and sleep. :P 
Ok cool! Still working?
Not really. I learned them in Algebra
Wbu?
D:
Geometry. I tried to take a double math period last year but my councilor couldn't fit it in.  
Haha. No problem!
How very modest. 
You made SMCS though. 
Yeah.  Math-Sci.  Born and raised. 
What do you think? Haha. 
Really?  Yayyyy!
Well that's not a positive way of thinking... What program are you in? 
Well I'm studying at the moment... Why? 
I think so. 
I don't think so. 
Kinda. 
Lol.  Confuzzled. 
Idk. I guess its the same. Really? Why didn't he?
Do you call it Clemente? 
but honestly it doesn't matter. It's such a small school so you'll get to know everyone!
I mean I came from Roberto sooo
Friends of friends.
Yeah. She told me.
MY BROTHA. And yeah. I go to the library a lot. I also happen to be friends with Jeanyoung.
You mean yesterday?
Wait. And how do you know?
Phew. Are you Ryan's sister?
Uhhh. o.O
Now that I think about it. That's pretty creepy. 
Ikr <3
My favorite animal is Mudkip tho
Pandas! 
Lucky guess? 
Oh Hai. I'm Katie. I like unicorns and rainbows and stuff.
xD
You wanna trade? I'll be Katie now.
And Thanks! Haha.
Oh yeah. Probably.

I definitely recognize his face, I just don't know where I know him from/ 
Kinda.
Sorry :D
transfered*
transfeded*
I went to Brown Station my first year. Then I transfer to a school in Rockville. 
Haha. It's ok. He totally would... What Elementary school did you go to? 
What?!? ._. 
Haha. We had dinner together the day before he left.
but then he moved </3
Haha nice. We pretty much grew up together :D
You know Varun?
don't be fooled though cause that water nasty
I live right next to longdraft and it's next to a big ass lake
#whateverittakes
Just following in the footsteps of Mr. Richards
I'm hip
Photos actually a lot of fun
We won a prize though!
We were just having connection issues
Maybe
But they have a shit ton of mentors on their team
They're decent
Probably
But we have next week though
Not good
We'll probably start as soon as the season is over
literally half of being a good team is having the money to be a good team
Cause we need to raise a shitload of money for next year
weren't you interested?
Are you really trying to do FIRST this year?
I'll probably take the ACT
ugh 2210
What did you get?
yes
everyone in denver can get sent to the moon for all i care
the broncos are fucking shit
it was a good tweet
what a beast
damn
rats
vid?
I didn't know ashley wagner was still relevant
damn
true
what
I'm a lion
sameeeeeee
chomp chomp
yum
"ture" ew what the heck is that
true*
ture
lolololol
you're the NEXT BEST legendary mvp
thanks
<3
thanks
hey, I kinda like that, it's gonna be my thing from now on
legendary mvp
mvp
legend
I know
http://www.northropgrumman.com/Pages/default.aspx
I want to get a internship from Northrop Grumman but I probably won't
RIP
I just remembered
Wait hold up
Winter break
same... I need to hurry up and find an internship dudee
yeah this was a longgg time ago
and I have a history of diabetes, you change what you can man
my dad's overweight
Probably
at least i try... It's completely different if you have an illness
I'm pretty athletic now
I had a girl call me chubby in elementary school
unless you have a physical or mental illness
when it comes to being overweight
and maybe this makes me a bad person but I've never felt sympathy for overweight people
oh true solid
What do you usually get on your SAT practice tests?
Btw
Byw
That's one thing that I just can't fade
But worse
It's like conner freshman year
He tries to suck everyone's dick and it's super annoying though
Honestly if had to pick anything to compare him to, it would be a parasite.
Why?
Captain*
If he's not off the team this year he is next year when I'm captains
I don't care haha
But we're always like "Sahil, what the fuck are you doing"
I don't think so
Lol idk
Just tell him to do nothing I guess
How I'm going to get through source america
Idek man
Him being on FIRST is like a bad joke
He's turned invent team into a joke
I know it's savage but it's the truth
He tries to do so much but sucks at everything
Messing stuff up
I can't risk that
I'm still friends with all my friends
Dude
The electrical system is my baby and one fuck up could break everything
Which is why I might just kick him off first
Just to not fuck anything up
I don't need him to work
At least they don't fuck stuff up
I'd take almost anyone in SMCS over him
And he's annoying af
The ones that he comes up with are shit
Ideas*
He has no idea
SourceAmerica
I'm legit soooo close from kicking him off FIRST
And is the most annoying person to work with
He doesn't get anything
He's just an idiot
Lol no
Kek
Whatchu sayin
I am funny
TWD haha
Idk it was on edline
also what was the Chapter #1/3 homework?
yeah alright cool
1.5*IQR right?
I've almost read every single word of Topics 1 & 2 in the AP book and it's so dryy
What was it on
was the stat quiz hard?
Yo
I don't know where the folder is haha
what's mr. curran's interview document?
thanks fam
just followed her
by private you just me protect my tweets right?
is that how it works
really
My twitter's pretty rough
yeah but still
like I friended her on fb
to add her on more than one social media platform
it seems thirsty
would following her on twitter be too risky
I'll live
this actually makes everything so much clearer
basically
so he's gonna manage a hotel in the heart of silicon valley <3
I KNEW I REMEMBER THAT SHIT
I told you about the picture she brought in for show and tell
where the presidental correspondents dinner is held every year
He's managed the DC Hilton
it's also makes sense why he met the president
yeah
he's*
He a general manager at huge Hilton hotels
I searched up Amelia's dad on LinkedIn and EVERYTHING makes sense now
it was pretty short
I too a nap today
I'm doing hw
?
how can I talk to her without coming across too strong
honestly though
I wish
what would I say though
yeah
maybe that's just my feelings for Amelia talking
I miss a lot of my old friends though
and there's a soft spot in my heart for Poolesville
I don't know
and I don't think it would make sense to transfer as a senior
you can't transfer that way I think
It's not my home school
probably not
to RM?
But I guess sometimes it's good not to
I like a lot of the people in Poolesville but I probably would have fit in better at RM
I ended up getting in but decided to go to Poolesville
A huge part of me still wishes I went to RM
Sometimes I wish I had just gone to QO
If only I was half as smart now :'(
Amelia got me thinking back to elementary school and how much of a beast I was back then
Most times, I'm pretty slow
I don't do well in school either!
What intangibles were you talking about?
?
If I have a stable job, and someone meaningful that's probably all I need
actually though
the more and more I think about it the less I care about money
I hope
Hopefully
Like the support system around me and the friends I have
I feel like 3 years down the road I'm going to miss this life so bad
Junior yeah is rough
basically
thank god we don't have school on friday
not a great week
And I'm already emotionally fucked up
School is killing me
man*
how you have ackerma
oops
I haven't been in that class all week
?
Is there a math quiz tomorrow
there's so much shit
I've literally turned off my music just so I can do work
some robotics, some programming, some school
so robots
like a mixed bag of random shit
really pissed this game's at poolesville
I have work
:'(
I'm also missing a meetup with my developers friends in DC
If it was at RM I'd probably go
yeah same
and I have work to do
just cause I'm so caught up in my feels and there's no 9th
I might not go to the game tomorrow actually
Exactly
This was too savage
wishful thinking
I know but I'm literally so pressed
exactly
this is so unhealthy
it's 11 and I'm literally still checking Amelia twitter every 10 minutes
nah I'm studying for the test tomorrow
yeah I try
haha
"glenn actually has feelings"
this must be strange for you
I feel so lost sometimes
thanks for putting up with all this bullshit btw
I really need more support in my life
I know a lot of people in SMCS are probably going to get into really great colleges and I'm happy for them but after high school the irrelevant people will just fade away and the real people will be there
no parents no classmates etc.
part of me wants to move to san fran after high school just to be alone
I live a pretty fucked up life
It just allows me to forget everything
I usually sleep a ton on the weekends not even because I'm that tired but because it's a n escape
A lot of days I hate going to school just cause I have to deal everything
I'm comfortable being around people but my best moments are when I'm just alone and can think
And even now as a high schooler even though I'm president and I have to talk to everyone and be really social but I feel like there are so many fake people
like people talked about how I was trying to "be black" and shit like that
lot*
back in middle school I hung out with a long of the "normal" kids and I got judged by the rest of the SMCS kids so hard
I try to be really social and talk to a lot of people but at the end of the day I try to have a really small circle
another thing is people hating me
which is why I try so hard to be as polite as I can to my friend's parents cause I want them to like me
just cause I dress a certain way and talk a certain way people rush to judge me
I know it sounds like a sob story but honestly that's happened to me more than once
and the parents literally said no and we grew apart
I wasn't a bad kid but I just was crazier than the others
back then we just did dumb shit
I got a lot of shit and even though I was a extremely good student. I specifically remember one day after school it was like a picnic or something and a couple of my white friends asked their parent if they could run around the school with me
I mean I had white friends but they were literally like the only two black kids in the school
when I was in elementary school my two best friends were black and I got a lot of shit
okay so
Can I rant for like 5 seconds?
talked*
I watched a video where they talk about their life and it was so relatable
they're vine stars
yeah
google
grayson dolan
ethan dolan
watched*
I just watch a video by the dolan twins and it was so relatable
nah sometimes I just need someone to talk to
thanks anyways
yeah it's fine
it's not your fault
nah don't say that
literally that become 99% and my work becomes 1%
so when I do fall for someone
and that other 1% really kills me
99% of my life is focus on work
ugh
i know
sad
so I just constantly check her twitter
I didn't want to seem thirsty
yeah
she doesn't even follow me ._,
I'm done
she tweeted
they're all so depressing
but it's so sad
yeah
good god
night changes
one direction gets me more into my feels
how is it good for me?
It's that bad
I've literally resorted to listening to one direction
ugh
Or favorited
Or RTed
Hasn't responded
Gym
Yeah
She's too cute to fight
No
Ugh
HELP
It seems weak
Never
Nah
I'm in such a rut
I literally can't think about anything else right now haha
I've literally been listening to Red on a continuous loop for a hour
sorry for ranting haha
I know this sounds dumb be sometimes I just need to talk to someone who doesn't care about all that stuff
my family cares so much about achievement
giving
family
fullfillment is about being happy
which is what makes is so hard
I really don't know
ugh
this is so stupid
I'm so afraid I'll spend my life on achievement and not have any fullfillment
he wasn't happy and unfortunately we lost a national treasure
Robin Williams was one of the most successful people in the firm industry but he had no fullfillment
and 2. Fullfillment
1. Achievement
Like in life I think people need two things
I feel like I don't have fullfillment in my life
It's all achievement though
yeah
oh
??
I haven't gotten around to it
just me
there's some pretty raw stuff in there
YOU
I'M TRUSTING
https://docs.google.com/document/d/128dES3QqeIsR9rutqoxXqamN48VLY7RwUEWWgtC3FSU/edit?usp=sharing
like I have to keep a journal to not go crazy
I have to learn so much stuff out of school
yeah
except lee and estep
like the teachers are all dicks
I work so fucking hard but get nothing out of it
nothing but work gets dry
that's what I've been doing and it's been a pretty miserable 2 years
since I'm planning to move to san fran to work, I have to learn everything I can now
right now graduation is like a deadline for me
I've always wanted to move to Tanzania
maybe I'll feed kids in Africa
Honestly, I feel like I'll be that guy who'll just make a bunch of money and have no where to spend it
I always do some shit wrong
like I'm terrible
just in general
either I have the worst luck or I'm just stupid
what does that even mean
What
like I could tell you what a guy typically wants
well do you understand yourself
but you talk to girls
You should understand better than I do
you're a girl
ugh
like what they fuck do you want
GIRLS ARE SO FUCKING COMPLICATED IT DRIVES ME INSANE
Brothers are so easy to talk to
anyways
check his insta
nah
and I hadn't seen him in half a decade
Like brothers
like this was my BOY back in 5th grade
https://www.facebook.com/josiahbv9
I guess it's different with guys
yeah I know
I guess it's just weird after this long
maybe once or twice
flame me
go ahead
idek anymore
but I don't think I got worse
of course not
5 years does that shit
We were actually kinda tight in elementary school
It's been a long time
girls are so frustrating
ugh
I don't *think* I'm terrible looking
I'm not a shitty person
I work my ass off
I'm relatively intelligent
like I work hard
hold up this is about to get real deep
Just in general
what am I doing wrong
real talk though
yeah
thanks fam
the song
it's so beautiful
it's ok, that's everytime I listen to that song
tears
like no joke
RED is my song
I'm doing my research article
TEARS
Red would literally kill me right now
I would just make me feel worse
it*
I actually is though
but it's impossible
it sounds easy
wtf
none of her friends are coming I think
I would except how the hell would I go about doing that
they only went to rockville because it's close and they got beef
but no one wants to come out to poolesville
specifically Amelia
so all my es friend would be there
I was hoping Thursday's game was at RM
I have so much work to do still
UGH
yeah
honestly it doesn't really matter
kinda
I have a lot of friends in the industry who have gotten it
Yeah
and it's in san fran
Apple gives high schoolers scholarships to the event where they release all their software
FUCK YES
<3
I'll be going there
but if I get the apple scholarship this year
Probably not
San Francisco is the tech capital of the world
my shit
THAT'S SILICON FUCKING VALLEY
I looked at her dad's profile and he says "Moved to San Francisco"
WAIT
maybe someday
yeah
I was going for the "black thug in his feels" look but white girl works too
ahahaha
maybe I always get shit for being gay
they're always on point
What about them
bruno mars and adam levine are so relatable
exactly
I lowkey haven't been able to get any work done all day
tuff
that's true
what's that supposed to mean
She hasn't read it yet
not*
no yet
nah I always do this shit though
I live a pretty fucked up life
oh hell no
:/
I'm actually trying to squeeze a date in if that's possible
kinda
unless I make berkley
I was actually going to move to California after high school anyways
how did I "ask for it"
why do you do this to me
i h8 you
I kinda liked her back then too
no idea
FACT
and she brought in a picture of her dad shaking hands with bush
maybe not the first day but it was pretty early on and we had to bring something in for show and tell
or 3rd
I think it was the first day of 2nd grade
in all seriousness though
exactly
what more do you want from me
I'm sure our elbows touched at one point or another
I mean we were in the same class for like 3 years
well
kinda
we were tight in elementary school
legit
we were talking earlier
yeah
assuming that's possible
I was hoping to slide in her dm and get a date in before she leaves
nah
do*
why do I dot this to myself
I know
why do I do this to myself
like soon
she's moving to california this year
real*
oh yeah and here's the really killer
and I'm just sitting here like
puberty works in strange ways
and all the eh ones are really cute now
all the girls I liked back then are eh now
one big step for programmers alike
one small step for glenn ren
this is new ground
basically
For sure
Lmaoo
Wild
hold up
is that weird cause like we used to ride the same bus
like i literally know where she lives
probably
he was being all defensive and it was really strange
nah yesterday

must be his time of the month again
and he was salty af
so I messaged chris about amelia
ahahaha

I don't think she went to my elementary school
nah
Hilarious
Her instagram bio is hilariously
I try
everytime*
like Ishan was messaging me and I told this man to hop off my dick cause everything my phone rang I thought it was her
hoping it's them
do girls do the same thing where you constantly check your phone
idk
I mean she hasn't read it yet
"Yeah. Aren't you guys undefeated?"
so I go
I think we're playing you in football this thursday
and she says
she asked where I went, and I told her poolesville
I texted her and she hasn't responded in a hour and a half
and I find like half of the girls that went there attractive
I went to a white elementary school in rockville
well
literally I realized that I have a type
but we haven't talked in like 5 years
we used to be tight in es haha
https://www.facebook.com/amelia.cowan.1

partially
i'm joking

I was thinking of buying brown shoes and a new brown belt
I guess
I only have one that still fits me but I wore that to hc last year
yeah
this is such a struggle
i'm asking cause i was just looking for suits online since i have no idea what to wear
but that would be dope
actually tho
true

Maybe
cause I have to go to the actual hc to help set up and take down haha

Ermergud.
I was looking over my notes and just realized. Do we have to do the animation links?
Done.
YEAH :D
Yep.
Mostly because you leave a better impression on your teachers.
Well. Not dumber. But less intelligent. 
Btdubs, the dumber the people in your block the better. 
It's a feeling :D I don't actually care.
I don't actually know. 
I like being around smart people. :D 
Yep :'( I hope I have Block A.
Exactly! I sent him 2 emails and he hasn't responded to either one. Everyone else has theirs. I think.

Though no one can outshine parameshwar
I've never looked cuter
It's on my iCloud
Yeah
Did you get it?
Nope :(
The good kush 
dammit
did she give a prompt?
what do we have in Liu's class tomorrow
no problem!
sorry!
if it's not too late
I haven't finished the homework yet but when I get it I'll tell you
generally they should either be the same or extremely close
i mean if the distribution is perfectly symmetric then yeah
not the same but they should be close
It helps me too!
if it doesn't make sense, I'll try to give a better explanation
I try
sorry
that's a terrible explanation
which means the range would also be higher
cause a higher standard deviation indicates that the difference between the other data points and the mean is higher
I think it does
which is the average of the squared differences between the mean
so standard deviation is the square root of the variance
I mean
honestly I'm not sure
umm
I had no idea what you were talking about
I thought you meant "high range" like they were a term
OH I SEE
what do we have in liu's class tomorrow
not sure what you're asking
?
who do you have
Legend
<3
Good
Absolutely not
Sorry zoough

I think so yeah
Your program doesn't fulfill that requirement
What if the users input is less than $10 tho? 
Yeah
Email me your code then
Email me your program at glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
Print whichever is bigger 
Compare that with $10 to see which is bigger. 
Then you find 2.1% of their balance
You ask the user for their account balance. 
This is kinda like Acsl
Haha. Ok
What do you mean 
is R&e due tomorrow?
Are the answers to the friction worksheet on Edline?

we wanna attract people to our booth so we can talk about the progran
just feel like that'd be a really cool demo that'd blow people's mind
well you wouldn't need to carry it around
I'm gonna try to see if we can get power to our booth first
Can you bring your 3D printer to Poolesville Day?
especially kids
and kids
i thought you love talking
It's designed to get kids interested in STEM
Talking to people about FIRST and just our team in general
thanks!
the void between kinda good and amazing
your presence fills that void
:)
for the team at least
it really would
That would be amazing
So there's gonna be a STEM workshop at Richard Montgomery next Sunday from 10am to 4pm and they'll looking for robotics teams to show off what they have and talk about the program.

How much did you buy it for again?
You used to love it lol
How is it?
You have a Dell Venue tablet right?
How'd the other one turn out
You sure?
Need a pic
Can I get this made into a sticker?
np lol
Sent
gotchu
but of course you do
yeah that's no happening haha
so I can name them appropriately
can I get the name of these cubes?
cause I'm saving this forever
that's okay
I gotchu
piece of cake
same sizes?
can your printer handle that detail?
It's pretty easy
I can do the text too
Sure
do you want the text too?
haha
:)
I could put your face on one of these if you want
That's not too hard
GOOD SHIT
oh shit that's actually pretty cool
?
that's not bad at all
hmm
damn how much
one*
did you buy ones?
What are you using to cut it?
I just sent the updated ones over
If you want lol
them*
For the center ones I just made two shapes and combined th
It's actually pretty easy, you just have to manipulate shapes that are built into inkscape
You want me to increase it?
Does it work?
I wouldn't know
utterly embarassing
Average of 5?
Ao5?
?
good shit
see if that one works
sent
yeah
should be
yeah
try that one
sent*
send
here I'll just send it to you
cause right now each sticker is about 14.6x14.6
so the dimension of each side of the cube is 52mm
wait
is each square 52mm or is each side of the the cube 52mm
do you still need it?
it*
I have in done as a svg
It's for Windows and Linux
you can just use inkscape and manipulate the shapes
but how far do you want them spaced apart?
I can do that
I've only switched over to inkscape cause I'm on *ix 90% of the time
try the new one I just sent
inkscape
since you gave me a relatively simple bw image, I just set the brightness cutoff
There's a trace bitmap function
mm*
I can use mmm
I still need a height and width
what color do you want the squares
And how many mm wide do you want it
do you want the background as a vector or the squares are vectors
I sent it to you but I wasn't sure
Each vector has dimensions
It's a vector
I can do both
which do you prefer
What format do you want it in?
Hey ya never know
Npp
Already in bed. 
I'll try something tomorrow morning
They need to be perfectly straight?
Is this for a Rubik's cube
Wait
You're talking about the ones in the middle right
?
Should be easy
Sure send me the image lol
And are you willing to pirate software
Are you on Windows or Linux?
Should I use the vacuum to suck up the excess solder?
Obviously
Well
What would I do?
I have a pretty thin tip
This wick just doesn't work
I bought a desoldering vaccum
No
Rip
This is literally the tutorial
Just to get it secure and lined up
I did pin two opposite leads first
And then remove the excess pins on the driver
By putting a thin layer of solder over all the pins
The tutorial I was using told me to get solder around every lead
I've been trying to use a wick for that but it's just not pulling any of the solder off
Got me so tilted
I've been trying to use a wick and it's not working 
What do you use to get solder off?
Hey
Ahahahahahahaha good one
You dammit
Yoy
I might go to root for yoy
Why
Bruh
Cubinmg?
What dis
Not yet
Cause I have no idea what I'm doing
Well I'm screwed
Is it hard to make a 2d gantry?
Isn't that good?
I go*
I got -5.93
Mediocre at best
Now I gotta figure out how to make a XYZ gantry with a electromagnet haha
truee
?
How would we build this contraption lolv
There are pieces in it's way
Like if a person's first move is a knight
That's what I'm saying
Do you know how knights work?
I mean
Gesterling would be proud
What do you meanv
How would we move knights tho
20 second is still fast af karl
Smh
Knights
Why would the XY gantry be under the board?
Them
But moving then is an issue
We can tell if there's a piece on a space
So right now this is the board
Any ideas?
But instead of a nozzle, it'd have a electromagnet
I'd need a contraption kinda like a 3D printer
I want to make the magnetic and use a electromagnet to move them around
Instead of having the pieces move around themselves
Idea
Ok so new ida
I'll figure something out
Worst case scenario, I'll just increase the size of the board
And needs to be programmable
Piece
Using it as a chess piecr
As small as possible
Asap
Asao
I need to make a tiny robot with wheels
What the smallest robot you've seen?
I'll probably get a steel
Yeah come to think of it
Is it really that much cheaper?
What about a Dragoma discoveru
What about a He3D Delta DLT180
Ain't nobody got time fo that
Ya feel
I just don't want something that's gonna give me a headache everyday
And a lot of people are saying that the kits from places like Ali come with cheap ass parts that need to be replaced often
I've been reading some forums
Thanks Karl 
I can come by
Can you show me your Prusa sometime?
...
400 dollars is a lot of money Karl
Yeah
Cause it's so expensive
I'll do a bit more research till I buy though
Yeah I probably won't have more than one extruder
What's the RUMBA used for?
Is that what you did?
And idk how I feel about ali
But it's so expensive
And I want a Prusa Steel
I've been doing a bit more research today
Up yet?
Thanks for the help 
I'm on my way to work lol but good night
I'll do some more research on my own
That's all
You right
What are some good subreddits for 3D printing
Last thing tho
I won't bother you any more and let you sleep
Ight
Reviews look pretty good
Your sleep schedule is crazy
Yeah
I don't wanna keep you up
What's the difference between the AliExpress Prusa and other metal one
AliExpress is kinda sketch sometimes tho
The TwoUp reviews aren't very good :/
I assumed that's how all printers worked
And LCD 12864
What do you mean by bowden
I'm willing to buy from AliExpress if it has documentation and is worth it
Do mean online or actually go there
Why wouldn't I be able to buy from China?
What was the first printer you made?
What are some good ones you know of that aren't on that list
I guess when I buy a printer I'm gonna need your help lol
Hmmm
Gotcha
From what I've seen two main factors is printing area volume and resolution right?
So I want something that I can dive deep into when I do and something that won't cause too many headaches to setup
But I don't have a lot of time
I really want to learn about 3D printers this summer
See this thing is
Good
Are Prusa's goos
Around 300-400
I'm looking for something that will help me learn, is easy to maintain and still good
I found this list: https://all3dp.com/diy-3d-printer-kit/
But this summer is kicking my ass
Cause I want to learn, I really do
But how hard would it be to learn how to build a 3D printer
I know it's hard to quantify
Having a watch makes me feel like a badass
Not gonna lie
I didn't see anyone take anything off your desk
No I don't know
It's actually pretty cool
They let developers write apps for Google docs and Google Spreadsheets
Google's opening it up to developers though
I like Google docs better but sometimes it's cancer af
That's cool
Did you put it all on a doc?
Nice
Yeah my bad I read that incorrectly
I know a really popular sponsor is Leidos
Huh didn't know they sponsored FIRST teams
Darpa's the government agency right?
I think we all did so we have to combine them lol
Ight cool
You started a list of sponsors right?
Yo
That's such a huge weight off my shoulders
Thanks dude
What colors do you have?
Actually which ones do you need?
Which colors do you have?
Woah
Are you out?
Is it possible for your printers to print this?
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1506334
IT EXISTS I SWEAR
Can't find it
Oh nevermind
When's your birthday
For an internship
How old are you?
Ok
Are you ok?
I'll live
Eh
That's cool
Ok have you started hacking yet?
Traffic
Still in nyc
No p
Ok
probably*
They might have one
Good shit
It's at 3 right
Oops
Aren't
You're overthinking this
Yes
And presentations
Teams are only for prizes
They dgaf
Yeah it's very casual
The teams are final until the project is submitted
Lmao you asked suriya
One my way
This city is fucking amazing
I'm still in New York
Yeah sure
Why are there different mealtimes
Bruh wtf
Meal times?
What
Team registeration is at the end
Didn't ask
:/
But it's all software
I have a pretty good idea of what I wanna work on
What do you want to do?
Sreya
Srey
Srey
Ishan maybe
Gonna come just in time for the ceo of github to talk
I'm still chillin in nyc
Be there at3
Whatever you wan
Or not
Bring karl
Karl
Your laptop and charger
It's like cywin but made by microsoft
Have you heard of cywin?
Not sure, you can probably find it somewhere
Thank god I'm still dual booting
Interested to see how good it is
I saw
There's so much other stuff you can buy
But tbh it's kinda pointless
One day I'll have the money
It's not even a rolex
That costs wayyy too much
It's so expensive
Why?
Fine
Pic
Oh well you're just a mess in general
My room is a mess
Yeah
I wanna put the printer on one of the cabinets
Also thinking of building a 3D printer
And the LED screen will give me notifications
It's gonna be a Amazon echo too
Electronic is more my thing
Nah
I'm planning on building my own alarm clock this summer
I know but it'd be nice to have
I need something smaller
I just have a bunch of stuff everywhere
I have a bunch of parts and cables everywhere
Hey do you know of any good organization drawers
Not sure
Her parents are I think
Sreya's driving
No
Cause I left it there
It's in my dad's car
It's closer than the school
There's gonna be a bus from Cherry Hill, NJ
Your parents
Driving?
You're going to hackBCA right?
Idk Karl things
I thought you sent it to me
I got a Dora watch in the mail.
The Dora one...
My parents were so confused
Got the watch...
Gnight
I'm going to bed
I guess if you don't do research
It makes your company seem cheap :/
It's dumb
But still
The "retail" price is slashed
Why are Invicta watches priced so high?
I'll
I wear a movado on my right hand and a smartwatch on my left
If I wanted functionality, I'd wear a smartwatch
But maybe next year
Tbh I don't have the money to buy one right now
Nah
Yeah they can be
I want a movado
Nah dude
I had to Google MVMT
But I'm about to go to bed
Nah you good
Just do it!
The raspberry pi echo
I'm just gonna play with the pi tonigh
Idk
And print it
Make a bust of yourself
It
Like
Lile
I
Your lack of confidence in me
Or lack thereof
Like the confidence
I have 2 now
I can let you borrow one
I have a bunch of projects I want to do with pi
But I'd probably get confused actually using the pi
I can spin up a node server in seconds
I would have kilt you anyway
Tbh I'm not even sure I have all the materials
Give me a minute
Chill I'm watching college basketball
Just for fun
The echo part of it
I just wanna see if I can get it working tonight
I'm gonna get one
No
What?
Can't fade that distance
That switch is a solid 2 feet away
And get it to turn off my lights
Put it next to my bed
Yeah
I'm gonna try to make an amazon echo using it
Sucks to suck
I'm joking
Fried it already :/
Just got it today
How'd you know?
Yes
For weirdos like you
That's why there's a 3D prize
I know
Yes
Software
What's a 3D printer?
I don't know?
I think they were talking more about creating something cool using a 3D printer
What do you mean by design?
But I sent a gif
What?
Hehe
Hax it
Idk
Are you bringing your printer?
True
You're going?!?
Not enough of our dumbass school signed up
No
I was actually going to tell you about that
Hey dere
Believe Karl
But silver is kinda boring
I guess
exactly
What if I got a gold watch 
And a wannabe
Not hipster enough
Watches make me feel tryhard
Legit though idk
Alright
Black vs white face?
Packaging game on point as well
Tiny hearts on the band and the stars next to her
Love the subtle details though
Not fucking dora haha
Lowkey
So I need a watch that says 80% we going hard and it's business time and 20% of me will always be a kid
To dress a little edgier
I usually like t
Right now I just got a 50 gift card and I'm looking for something to spend it on
I guess I have my pebble
I dont have that kind of cash
I really might just buy a moto 360
What about internals?
Not bad
Lmao
Lmao
Or like a citizen or something
I think senior year my parents were gonna get me a movado
I might get a bulova
I like a simple design
A good strange
I'm all about looking strange
Might just get a moto 360
Ugh
It'd mess up my hipster street cred
You know I can't go with the flow like that
What's a not completely garbage watch I can buy for under 75
What have you been up to kark
Lmaooo
Are you staying tomorrow?
packet?
Do you have an article?
Thanks
I see
What's your opinion on that?
http://deltaprintr.com/
Hey did you have an article this week?
your
Oh shit you need you're calculator right?
I won't
At CSAW
Yeah
Yes
I'll probably just go to sleep lmao
That's fine
And looked over the textbook but I'm still so scared
Like I did the worksheets
What should I study for math?
In the group chat
I saw
Yo
I think I'm gonna build a 3D printer over the sumemr
ok
yeah
What's on the quantum test tomorrow?
Pi 3*
Hey I'm buying a pi zero
Nice
That's the dumbest shit ever but I understand
ain't nobody got time for that
It's like a 15 minute drive
Ugh but it's so far away
It says in store only :/
link pls
ebay?
So put that! Explain what you want to know more about and about a project that you're interested in
Exactly!
It's what YOU hope to learn and accomplish after all
Just write your own personal thing
I know that can be hard for you lol
your*
It's an application since they can only have a certain amount of people in their venue and there's a high demand so really try to really sell you excitement.
Ok then put yeah
Have you been to a hackathon before?
cause a ton of people from poolesville entered their information but never actually hit submit
Make sure to actually submit
Yeah
Teah
That's what I trying to get
You can bring your 3D printer and we can do a hardware hack!
I just realized what you were taking about haha
I feel like you'd have a lot of fun there
?
It's a high school hackathon
http://hackbca.com
Hey sign up for hackBCA
Beef 
I saw this and I thought of you
https://twitter.com/mlhacks/status/703632887304818688
and Sunrise Calendar (for long term dates)
Workflowy (for projects)
I use Google Keep (for quick to do lists)
I'm not sure then
Like a numbered list
You can just make a list
Google Doc?
It's bullets but it has a really nice natural order
I use a thing called Workflowy
Why don't use just use a spreadsheet?
Lol
Customize it to specific needs
Tbh if I were you, I'd write my own :)
Not just bullets?
Something with order?
I know all about to do lists haha
hey
I cry
I need to put 4099 and falcons first somewhere
that looks so much better to me
not yet
but the captains like it for some reason
I really hate it
halp
Yo do you have any ideas for the t shirt?
I'll do it this weekend
Just threw them on the site
I didn't do it but I think suriya did
Good catch I'll get that fixed
Weed
Dank
Dang it

Phone
My
Sorry
Ok
Oh
What
Pics
Yeah
And it kept resetting
We figured it out when we were all 4 drive train motors at 100%
Yep
Yep
for?
very "out of the way"
I just like the low profile
oh yeah
haha you were looking at that one?
Oh yeah
?
good one
lel
I need a new laptop
since I have a pebble
I just can't justify spending 250 on it right now
Round are nice
I just thought I'd put that in
no
or act like one
A round is a good intersection between smart and a watch that doesn't make you see like a douche
Yeah bands aren't very expensive
or maybe a pebble round
When I get the cash I want a Apple Watch
Yeah that's cool too
but it's pretty rugged so it fits my needs
I've been thinking about switching the band out
I'm sure you can find it somewhere
not sure
Oh lugs
most pebbles do
not 100% sure on that
maybe it's changed now
Yeah cause I saw one on sale a while ago and thought about buying it
and I think it might only work with samsung phones
ugh I'd never use gear
yeah
year
but for a watch thats under 50 it's not bad
of course it could use some additional functionality
But I've never actually used Android wear
I really like pebble
why not
sure
I'm just messing with you
*poser*
*cough*
*poser*
No
alright I'll just convert it thanks
the width and length of the base in inches
I'm mapping out the board and that would really help
what are the dimensions of the stand
Hey
since it's going to be taking a beating
But I'd really like to get a couple of more 3d parts to secure down the board
Yeah I'll try that
and the intake takes 1
the actuator takes 1
the shooter takes 2
Cause the drivetrain takes 4 talons
bruh
How long are the 3D hubs orders going to take?
We'll make do
Fine
we just need that
I thought FIRST comes first
how many 3D hub orders do we have?
okay then we just need 1 more
are we going to be using the other 2 linear actuators ?
I mean
for the ten talons
since we need 5
Like the last 2
Can you print the other 2 in gold?
fine
:)
I just wanna know if it worked
please
can you check?
is it done?
How'd the print come out?
Tbh it was kinda annoying only cause my pebble is sitting on my desk vibrating it's ass off
I got ya
I understood the majority
More or less
Interesting
I see
Without a heated bed or something
Yeah I read that ABS warps a lot easier
Bot
If we could use it on the bor
And that would be really dope
What's stronger abs or pla?
Do you actually have gold plastic?
Wow ok then
Why?
What type of plastic is that?
I see it
So how many are printed now
It works
Fine the link isn't working
Karl pls
Are we talking about the same thing?
Any updates?
yeah
fine
i said black though
wait karl
black
I cri evrytiem
black would actually be great
black is fine
Really?
we on that goth flow
Also please print everything in black
They said PLA works best
but we'll need them at competition
it's not super duper important for now
They just secure the PWM cables
they're pretty small prints
2 of the large cable magics
http://wildstang.org/?p=585
I might also need to print this
which is perfect
but 3 towers allows us to mount 6 talons tomorrow
we're going to be using 5 in total cause we have 10 damn talons
my bad
AHHHH I SEE
but we
3 by tomorrow morning is perfect
rip
we're probably going to need 5
wer
how many do you have printed?
wait
both?
Done with the 3rd?
I'll give it a shot
God dammit fine
?
Is it possible to have 3 total by tomorrow morning?
How many more mounts were you able to print?
Hey
We'll see
I'm thinking that I'll do it over the summer
the uno is more for fun
uno
but I enjoy software development first
hey dude I have an arduino
Macbook pro tbh
I have to buy a MB pro first though
I'm thinking of buying one
True
Weren't you the one that criticized me haha
This is for FIRST
Lol
We'd need 5
when we secure it to the board do you think it'll be robust enough to keep everything together?
nice
Did it print?
Thanks dude
lol alright
that way I could plan on the board layout
cause it'd be really helpful to see if it'd actually work
Can you check
lmao
who does this shit
wth Karl
You're joking right?
how come?
any updates?
Please
Wait hold up
Pls
Have you started printing yet?
alright
Hey, we're going to put the pvc pipes to space out the shooter right?
oh yeah you right
pls
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:640102
oh I see
ew
I've never had them but I'll take your word for it
my bad
can you print it after that's done?
..
can you print a talon stand right now?
do you have any black plastic
yeah that makes a lot more sense
OH I SEE
but what are the advantages of extrusion vs square beams
we'll worry about that when we're there lol
it's neater to run the wires too
yeah
cause our bot's going to take a beating
I'm just worried about security
looks pretty good
http://www.thingiverse.com/make:118825
Your opinion is very valuable to me
I'm meant I'm not sure yet
something like that?
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:640102
I'm thinking of stacking the talons
nah
For electrical
Yeah
One of them?
Are you printing anything right now?
I more wanted to go see some people
I am
I qm
It's just learning how to use sensors i think
I mean I have a Arudino kit at home
Not sure
And it's a Terrapin Hackers meetup
Cause we don't go to UMD
Plus idk if I'm even allowed to go
I think it's going to be pretty basic
Maybe
It's at UMD
Lol
?
Ok
see ya
I got work to do
alright
boy
so it'll be fine
40 max
I think we're using 14
what gauge is that for
so that won't work
we need 10000 amps though
amps?
cause we need them asap
cause I already bought them off amazon
It's kinda late
I got you
for some reason
but everyone uses anderson
i don't think it's regulation
lol
it doesn't have to be today llo
when you get the time can you print a couple of these
maybe we just installed them wrong
idk
cause they were printed shittly
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:675138
and my databases and stuff
I was just interested for web development
well, that's where we're different
though*
It's integration with google docs is perfect thought
What's the point of having your own server?
for the server?
true
since you were running out of space
http://gizmodo.com/you-can-get-2gb-of-free-google-drive-storage-today-1758004392
Yes
That's it
Is it done
Ok
And send them to me
Do you have them?
That's fine
Yeah
Drive works
What's the most lossless?
Lel
Oh oops

Sk
I'm not there
Idk
Same for me
Yep
Yep
Perforated aluminum make the nicest boards
damn
hmmm
Could we create that bellypan?
http://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/img/83a/83ae2bad5e65bf8dad220b0e5c876e1e_l.jpg
I'd think it'd be a quarter grade
I actually don't know
sorry
no idea
Up you butt
Not at all
Yeah
I was in the R&D room
Are you here yet?
Shit
Still
Ok
We want to epoxy something before 1st so it can dry during class
Let me know when you get here
Ok thanks
Don't forgot to bring it
Is it done?
bed*
or are you still in be?
how's it looking
it'll*
It's kinda high but I'm sure after a couple of months it's drop like a beat
Cause it's priced at 600?
What era?
what
...
cause it's 3 in the morning
please don't forget the device at home though
I'll stop bugging you
wow ok
?
good night dude
haha that's fine
yo
do you have any pictures?
that's good to hear
Thanks!
How much in plastic do you think it cost?
Alright
I thought it was 2
What
I know I'm being annoying but I just really wanna know
It it almost done
Oh man
I'm really desperate
Now?
ok
It would sice my life
Can you go check
did it crack
please dood
and idea if it's cracked or nah
do you have
what do mean
pls
is it going well
karl
Me right now
what's the status
thanks
have you started yet
ohhh ok
won't you print the other object too?
should I remove the sponge object for when you 3d print it?
btw
ok I'll try that out
like is there a built in way
Can I make a video of our device rotating in Fusion?
bless
can you print it in black
alright
will it crack this time?
oh yeah
why was it cracking before?
do you think I has a strong likelyhood of messing up?
cause I'm afraid something will mess up again
please dude
When is your printer free?
okay I get it
good?
could it even be...
better?
front?
which should be the base?
I see
what do you mean?
not sure how to do that
The right side view is kinda awkward though
Better?
I'll make the change
ight
is this bad
I was viewing the wrong project
I see
When i click on the model it's still the old one
how do i view it
azeem
lol
inches
idk
just sent it to you
sent
this is your email right?
karlzhao314@gmail.com
can only moderators send invitations?
I'm incompetent but not that incompetent
just did
I really have no idea what I'm doing
sigh...
should I just extrude every side then
what
but it's already off
that's what I thought visibility was
how pls
and then turn off visibility?
how do I go into isometric
I know this is a dumb question but
I can't select it
I drew the two rectangles
no idea how to do that
?
?
how do I get rid of the old ones and uses the new one
I drew a rectangle
this is where I'm at
When I right click there's no option to do that
can I just extrude every side?
how would I do that
okay
I'm asking for advice from the grandmaster
how does this look?
I see
Isn't our device smaller than your though
really?
what
could you do the same for ours
what are you printing?
can you print right now?
I did it haha
I want to make small walls around the flat part that sticks out
how can I make walls
How's that look?
pls
oks
hello?
how do i do that
right?
I need to make the corners thicker right>
Hey, I got on the model
lol...
wth
nice
is it*
how close it?
what about now
How's it lookin?
How
Bless your soul
ok
?
is it done?
duddeee
what color is it?
I'm so confused
wait what
why is it in a state of flux then?
I see okay
what color will it be printed?
whats*
that's a blue-purple shifting abs
what's that?
YES black is great!
what
classic karl
what's the status with the device?
yo
ok karll
ugh
"videos" eh
hmmm
NO ONE STORES VIDEO ON THEIR SERVER
why
jesus
depends how much you need
eh
cloud computing dudee
no one uses in-house servers anymore
you can buy one online
I will take that under consideration
wow
check it
yeah
good stuff indeed
Good stuff karl meow
yessir
in going to kickoff
that you're interested
Reply to the FIRST email
Do you have an estimated date of when you can print our device?
Make something useful
I don't know
we'll seee
idk
ok
I'm talking about
that's exactly what
Lol you're the most bipolar person to talk to
I'm not trying to switch operating systems everytime I want to switch between programming and cad
if only it ran on linux
How are you going to just hit me with that "ok"?
Fusion 360 is actually pretty cool
Dammit Karl
5 minutes
Do you have a picture of the English booklist
true
you might just have a ton of broken parts though
if you're up for a challenge I guess

Ok
I actually have no idea what you said
I didn't really hear what you said to me as I was walking by
Wait a minute
haha that completely destroys the functionality
they're not good, just kinda there
Removing them would look worse in my opinion
I just don't know how they would make it different
I don't like them
I think making the camera that being looks obnoxious and throws off the aesthetic but it'll be different for everyone
we're just going to have to agree to disagree then
I just extremely hate the way it looks
Yeah, centering it was a good idea
I really hate the logo and the HUGE camera sensor
or 6 or whatever
Honestly tell me a phone you think looks better than the iphone 6s
Karl
the sony experias are literally the iphone without the plastic band and they're the most boring looking device on the market
I just have no idea how they would do it since that's not my job

An all metal unibody phone would look terrible imo

Of all the things to scam I think it's very unlikely that someone chose to scam you on a 3d printer
Probably not
What do you mean
I'm joking
That's what I'd do
Tough luck

I don't get you

It's mostly gonna be use for pdfs
windows vs android?
(I'm going to be using a iphone 6s as my daily driver)
anything else?
but there's a ridiculous amount of pdfs I have right now
not just that
Do you know of anything like that?
I'm looking for a good cheap productivity tablet (preferably over 7 inches) that's mainly going to be used  for pdfs.
I know you have good intentions but sometimes people may misunderstand you.
Nonetheless, I'm researching the answer! :)
Hey! I'm just saying this as a friend but your post in the SMCS group is one of those things that tend to rub people the wrong way

Karlllllll
How was the math test

you said you found the driver to my laptop?
yeah i've read a couple of their forums
:'(
pc part pick doesn't share any of its data
that would be inefficient as hell
don't they also tell you compatibility
yeah that's what I was thinking, except I don't have the hardware for that
Yeah of course
btw they're looking for $950 for the titan
but what about from scratch
that significantly changes things
I was looking if they had an api but it seems like they don't
how difficult do you think it'd be making a pc part picker app
Hasn't responded
I'd love to have you on the team
Alright
Which is more than I can say for most people
Not stupid
We could really use someone with your skills
Btw
You should join first next year bte

sometime can I come over to your house during study hall
hey
thanks
nothing don't worry about it
haha nevermind I was going to ask you something
is your 3d printer easy to use
how would you revise this
alright so i'm building a hackingtosh
dual boot
so be frank
i found it
this isn't even my build
lmao
what do you mean
http://pcpartpicker.com/p/9MWksY
opinions on this build?
like what
what did we do in nsl today?
Apple makes premium products, if you don't like them, don't buy them. It's as simple as that
If I made that, I'd be pretty damn embarrassed
it is
yeah
this whole time I told you that's its an poor excuse for a designers work
I could design 90% of google's material design apps in my sleep. It's simple and it's cutting corners. I never said it was trash
HOLY SHIT
I'm curious
and what would you know about that
better design?
It's what poor designers call "design"
unlike material design which is just embarrassing
Apple products are cleaner and better designed
did karl say something good about apple
wow
"tech and innovation"
macbook
it obviously is this much since they're charging it?
what
you always pay a premium for apple products
never said it was priced well
why do you need a nano
that's nice
damn
the pentium should be fine for everyday use right
ok
cause i don't want to splurge on a gpu and not use it
cause he says he doesn't need to really run anything over csco
it's just a Pentium seems a little underpowered
idk
what would the build for that be
ive been talking to my brother
sorry
how much money would it take to make a decent computer running counterstrike
what would be a recommended cpu upgrade?
sorry i got caught up
?
extreme
why?
amd vs intel, amd vs nvidia. I'm so overwhelmed
definitely build over buy right
he wants to play games like crisis 3, csgo, and stuff like minecraft
my brother is trying to build a gaming pc for 700
hahaha
computers hah
hey can I get some advice
anyways... its like butter for a standard cube
ill bring it tomorrow
anyways
its pretty hard
lmao
i can't open it
idk
my brother got one from math olympiad and i was like holy shit
www.rubiks.com/store/product/new-rubiks-3x3-cube#

I saw the pages but I don't know what the equivalent is on my book
what
cause i still have the old book from leong
Like chapter 11.x?
Where do the nsl notes go to?
I'm trying to show my dad what we did in math but I lost mine

?
midterms
i don't know about you but these two weeks aren't very good for me
sup
haha
like the backslash part
<html></html>
<html></ht>
tbh the only thing annoying about html is getting used to closing your tags
just practice
html and css are easy
you should probably learn html,css and javascript first
for android or iOS
me too
twitter api
facebook api
and it deletes all your posts before that time
like you select a time
I'm also in the process of making a app that allows you to delete your social media history
the idea
this could work
?
?
so like a vacation responder on a smaller scale
yeah sure
yeah
app*
I'm thinking of making another apps
also
still working it out
Like I since APs are coming up I'm thinking of making a high school ap book exchange
also what do you think of a high school ap book exchange
Is there a drawing/design class
Nice
Fuck bio
Lol
Everything
Yeah
Idk
And it'd actually be pretty useful
I could sell it to home depot or Lowes or something
Should I make a app that let's you pick a color and then shows you how to make the color using paint.
looking at my backpack
i thought of an idea
yo
fight me
Fuck yo7
I have issues bruh
Idk
Actually is tho

You don't have to
well you you the document I shared with you?
we've gotta work on the poster
what up
yo
I guess you're right
you?
?
its only for poisson distribution
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution
Let's decide by 7:15
and we can test algorithm against algorithm
I just feel like prediction is much more straight forward
what do you think
I'm researching that right now
I'm working on it
Here
Alright
2:30?
i can't come at 2
What time
It's the HTC version of Android

Yeah sure
You can make the map without it
Depends
Just did
We're going to have to meet for a few hours this weekend for ScienceMontgomery. It that all right?
Our abstract is a lot like our research plan
I found a method but I gotta eat dinner so hold on
Only the last paragraph
And I've been working on the abstract
._.
Day
Since I talked to her for a while that date
Me
She kinda knows mr
I forgot which date
Since I drove up to her house
I got this
Nah email
I'm gonna talk to the sciencemontgomery lady
There's nothing that stone can do
Tbh
Aren't forms due on the 21st
What is this shit
Whatttt
How
What
alright
based on the statistics that are the most important
and make our own algorithm to calculate the damage
We should compare two different disasters
and change it later
I'll just bs something
you know what.
and you can't have any without having done it.
cause you need conclusions.
how
we didn't even finish our project yet...
wtf.
OH SHIT.
and lots of google searching
Lot's.
or something along those lines
we have the highest change to win something from hurricane damage
but to be honest,
yeah.
and verify that it's a reliable souce
and we're going to need a lot.
Yeah, from what I've been looking at so far, I can't find the data
With a lot of hard work we can pull it off.
My problem right now isn't calculating damage.
oh ok
I might have to do a bit more research
Do you have an idea of what data we need for that?
What do you mean?
?
Alright?
???
Did you think of anything?
jk
well hurry up fool
?
ideas?
we need to narrow it down to a general area and a general goal
Cause I'm actuallly not 100% sure what I'm going to do
like what?
have you done anything for science montgomery yet
Np
FYMVXE
Which one do you use the most
Preference?
Troolnoodles?
It
I'm doing jt
Right now
Yeah
So I just did the best I could
No
Partly cause I started before I knew he wanted us to backfill
I didn't want to backfill
Alright
Alright
What
And draw a example of what our map will look like
Dude just research something
Read rubric

Got ot
Did you get a journal
Btw
Yeah
Oh ok
?
Reference?
All right thanks

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

How do you download
http://www.movie4k.to/Disney-s-FROZEN-watch-movie-4920421.html
Hey, How did you download frozen
What's your noodletools username?
what do you think?
I just found it to be easier and more practical .
the kit makes a assembly line.
we're making these kits
no.
what do you mean?
yeah?
how do you like it?
:D
and introduce it to under privilaged students for a low price.
so what we're making is a teaching tool to expand the knowledge of technology.
and make a train using the assembly line they just made on their own (using the kit)
use the parts to make a simple assembly line.
learn electronics from it.
the african kids get the kit.
what we're trying to make is a kit with parts.
while teaching the african students about electronics. 
the goal is to make it as cheap as possible
in africa.
so we'll try to make a toy to make this more fun for students.
wait.
into a very simple wooden train for example. 
for example, we take a stack of wooden blocks, paint them, and then put them together. 
and get and more complicated.
off*
in a line. 
so we can start of basic, like painting.
later
haha
I'm thinking of building an assembly line to quickly and easily mass produce things.
For example, many schools in Africa do not have adequate supplies to run their schools. 
In today's world there are tons of people who have great ideas, they just lack a way of mass producing their products.
like everyday.
you'll have to talk to joe
idk.
I went to a FIRST robotics meeting today (I'm in electrical) and I realized how over our heads we were.
cause a hand is too hard.
yeah.
making industrial robots more practical.
I'm thinking of changing our science montgomery idea.
hey
I know you know.
infinite looop.
          print ("FML")
While True:
fml'
fml
fml
what.
30
what did you get in math
alright
Yeah. I'm going to ask her tomorrow
Yay! ScienceMontgomery project has been processed :D
collection*
What did you put for data correction?
What did you use as the title?
I just got home. 
got it
Just email it to me bro
Yeah.
Cause I don't see tons of real world applications. 
Hmmm.
lol 
._.
that way we're on the same page
Send me your half of the research paper first
Yeah. What did you mean by the title?
What do you mean?
Sorry. Just saw this.
You or me)
I dont think it matters.
Really? OK.
Do you want me do write it?
Since its a rough draft it shouldn't take too long at all.
It depends how detailed you want it to be.
Alright 
Tomorrow right?
A bit. You?
What's on the math quiz tomorrow?
what's the comp sci homework again?
Ok. You can start and I'll edit and add details.
Where is the form?
I'll do it. 
got it 
ok tell me when its done
video?
then make one
upload it to dropbox
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
?
????
Do you have the video so I can edit it.
THIS WILL BE EPIC.
But, I'll need to practice python.
We can make this prosthetic leg electrical instead of mechanical.
Pie.
Frickin.
Raspberry.
Well. Three for some additional flair.
Yeah. Sorry it's late but I've been doing a lot of research for Science Montgomery and I have two words.
- making the limbs quick and easy to take on and off
- making the limbs cheap yet high quality
For example: 
Hey Justin, so I was thinking about science fair and what we could do and I still really like your prosthetic arm/leg idea. While this is an excellent project on it's own, I believe that if we really do use this as our project then we should add in more real world applications.  
idk
I'll work with you if you don't make it about spoderman...
Hey Yash, do you buy school lunches currently? Have you purchased school lunches in the past? If so, you should take this survey that MCR-SGA is sending out to gauge student opinion on school lunches!

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

Alright cool
What culture did we have for Spanish this Unit?
oops
Are there any disadvantages to not doing CTFs in a VM?
This is what I'm reading right now for srp haha
what were you thinking specifically
good shit
lol
northwest?
or try at least
i'll think of something
i solemly swear i am up to no good
like what
sure
I haven't received an official offer yet but I might go back
lmaoo
YES
People were bomb af
Fourth floor was pretty great
2691
This year I was a Northrop too haha
hopefully next
I'm trying to intern there one summer
ahahaha geekkkk
I'll probably major in CE too lol
I love NYC soooo much
I know
I know
I know
maryland's cheaper for in state
idk
i'm a year younger than kent
I just need a laptop that I can use for dev, running VMs, graphic design and a bit of video editing
I bought a Lenovo 410p freshman year thinking I was going to play games but I never did
As well as they would natively?
How do VMs run on macs
I was gonna ask about that
lmaooo
I'm not super familiar with OSX but how does it compare to Ubuntu
I have a iPhone too so a huge factor is the ecosystem
Ubuntu*
I was gonna dual boot it with Ubunutu
I'm trying to decide between a 13 inch Macbook Pro vs the XPS 13
You have a 13 inch Macbook Pro right?
Like interesting places related to anything tech
?
Any good tech places
Cause I'll be heading there during spring break
Hey what are some cool places to go in NYC
Hopefully
It'd probably just be freshmen trolling though tbh
FOR REAL THOUGH
I still do a wide variety of stuff cause I haven't found anything that I've gotten SUPER into yet
I like what it enables me to do
and applying it to other stuff
I like computer science in general
I'm really not sure
It's tough but I'll live :)
Yeah you're right
Just making a ton of jokes about how we were gonna choke
I guess rightly so lmao
Cause someone on their team was talking a TON of trash
It's just kinda hard
Oops
Lol should I just have taken a shitload of screenshots
Had a ton or fun though and I guess that's what matters
I took what I knew about web and linux and applied it
Literally I rarely do cyber
Yeah I guess that sucks a lot more
Yeah
Thanks
Live and learn
Yeah it's just really disappointing
What separated 1, 2, 3, and us?
Damn
Hey did you get a chance to look at it?
ok thanks
what did we need to change with our writeup?
I'm gonna try and finish
alright thanks
since it's over
hey can you enable the mcpshsf site?
You might have to make some change to style.css though
.html file lmao I should probably get to bed
That's the simple chals.hsf file
http://pastebin.com/yZGAYhV1
I'm tired as heck
Ok sure
How long are you gonna be up for
I'm still trying to get better notifications
It's pretty bad lmao
really not trying to merge shit though
I have mostly everything working on my end
you up?
yo
What time are you going to bed?
and is there an option to remove connections?
and when are you going to bed?
what's going on with the google doc?
ok cool
Can we give a quick demo before everything starts?
Ight good looks
you good for tomorrow?
other than the small stuff
ok cool
And I'm not sure if you've noticed but for some reason the challenges page is scrollable
It's still kinda janky
I will
But I'm still thinking how I should organize it
I got the modals working
Where you at?
The color of the node is different
what'd you add?
and what did you add?
what do you need me to do?
Do you have a list of stuff that needs to be done
what do I put as CTF name?
where do I go from there?
I'm one the setup page
yo how should I set it up?
I got a Stat and Calc test tomorrow
I might not work on it till later today
I followed you
glennren
I'm really not that pressed to win lmao
Hold up I'll follow you
Lol I won't
It's private right now
I won't
Ok
Coming
Not exactly sure what you mean
Alright
What do you still have to do? Isn't the framework all set up?
oh nevermind see bootstrap
Did you guys build this framework from scratch?
they're
I think they'll all "password"?
Joan
On the demo site
?
Y'all used "password" as the password
I went to CTFd
LMAOOO
we'll try 293 if it's ope
Yeah that should work
Where are you meeting with Estep?
There are no cool kids dude
Where you wanna meet
Sure that works
See ya tomorrow
That sounds dope
Awesome
*compete
Will I still be able to test?
Alright cool
Yooo
ight
Sounds good, do you have a estimated time ?
What stack are you using?
What do you still have to do?
Alright that's no problem
Or like assistance with CSAW?
Hey you need help?
Yeah just let me know
still*
It's since a work in progress haha
We're using the LAMP stack
We're using the boxes in software design
Yeah
What do you need
That'd be dope
I'll help if you need
It's all good
Do you know when the new site will be up?
Awesome thanks
Yeah I'm trying to practice for that :/
Cause you know the CSAW thing at Montgomery College?
Has it moved somewhere or is it gone forever?
Hey the website is down :(
Alright thanks
Hey do you know where I could find old HSF writeups?
how?
Damn
wat
??
Will the HSF site get back up
Huh didn't mean to type that
,,?,,
Sureee
Surely
gnight
True shit
I got school tomorrow
I'm gonna sleep now
Yeah I guess we all enter high school pretty damn strange
The freshmen this year are much much worse
That's a way to put it
Our class is super toned down compared to others
But still very SMCS
Better than the majority I'd say
I'm still very SMCS at this point
True
I'm probably just overthinking it
This is for homecoming
I'll worry about prom in the spring
Righttt
CS yeah righty
Yeah that's not going to happens
Eh
Is ridiculous
Alison Huber
I cry every time
Savage
You're
You terrible
wtf
You guys look super similar
Ik
Yeah ok
I've just seen her around before
Junior lmao
Af
Haley Harkins is hot ad
Alright ummm
I guess it's just her siblings
Oh yeah
Her brother and sister are beast track runners
I'm talking about Carolina hahahahahahahaha
Except that her family is crazy athletic
I don't really know her
Really?
Good work
WHO WAS IT
What a legend
Sure why the fuck not
Idk about that one
You might actually know these people
ITS DIFFERENT FOR ME
I don't know any of these people lol
Spot
Damn you put me on the sport
So hip
None of them are in SMCS
"Crush on" hahah
Oh god
Legend
What
And never really hung out with anyone I really liked
I just never got the concept of asking someone as a friend
Like I'm literally in a groupme where my friends are planning hc lol
That's sick
Yeah
Life is just a jumbled mess
I'm SGA so I have to go to homecoming but I don't have anyone to go with so I really don't wanna go
Yep
Soooooooo
Ahahahahahaha good one
"We're cross platform"
Nice
It's cause I CAN lose track of time when I'm trying to make cool shit
That's why I like hackathons so much
Like I'll just lose track of time
Programming
I get carried away a lot
Yeah stuff like that
UI/UX
I do a bit of design
And cut out all the bullshit
How did you manage your time?
Yeah that's what I try to do
And I run a small first team
Well Lee made me a "Junior Captain" so there's a bunch of logistics to do
?
Robotics
Week*
I go through every weekend looking forward to the weekends
How did you stay sane
I use a github list to try to keep track of everything but I still feel overwhelmed
There's just so much going on man
Ahahaha that's so true
I feel like Estep does a good job of combing the two since we're graded on what we actually learn
Exactly
Sad*
It's said that some people value GPAs over learning
All most people do is bs and get programs but I'd actually like to do every single one
Jesus Michael
What
It's all based on your PSAT right?
Lmao
I'd like to get national merit but tbh idk how important it actually is
They all have different vibes
Yeah definitely
My stupid autocorrect
Shittt
Shirt
Honestly the more and more I look at it the more UMD grows on me
Wait I'm confused
It's just one of those things...
Idk
It's looking kinda sad right now since everything's coming loose haha
Stan
I basically have a board of all my goals
AP Stat, Analysis of Algorithms, AP Lang, BC Calc, Thermo, Cyber, Elements of Computing Systems and the R&D
Uhhhhhh alright
Like I have school work
For school and other stuff
There's so much to do but not enough time
I'm in a really bad slump right now
Like when you work to a point when you're just sick of everything
Hey do you have any experience with burning out?
it went up early
What happened with HSF
Nick wanted to know
Thanks
what time does csaw start
hey
But he said he doesn't know how much Carolina had to do with it cause apparently she was on a team with geohot
And carnigie won 2nd
He said he saw both you and Carolina at csaw
Alright sure
Estep was telling us about him the other day
What a legend
it that new or am I just late haha
https://play.spotify.com/album/0v1LY6ocSVgPO686pjz550
I remember going to your presentation but forgot what it was on

https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fiscalnote
fiscalnote.com

I wanna intern at a DC startup for my SRP but idk if curran will let me
Oh I see.

isn't django really bloated?
Mongo, Express, Angular and node

Right now I'm more for a front-end dev although I'm trying to learn the MEAN stacl
I'm not very good at Cyber

That's the goal haha
I'm basically trying to sweep all the comp sci courses
Yeah I am

what was you project on again?
and I have no idea where to look
cause I'm trying to find a cs internship that's not cyber
where did you do your srp internship at?
bout to go 10-0 with that strategy
tru
cause i just joined this year and i'm wondering if you have any tips
Hey you weren't you really nice at debate last year
I need a ride but Ashwin isn't picking up.
How is transportation going to go tomorrow?
alright thanks
Do you know Ashwin's number?
Justin engineering skills are on point xD
You should take a bit of your awesomeness and share it with the rest of us people.  Haha
Congrats! 
lol
ahahaha
lol
nice shit
?
I have*
I also worked extensively with current SMOB Justin Kim.
Yeah.
Elections coming up bro
All the candidates that I know have already been preparing for a long time.
And just fyi,
I'm not sure about all of the students but in the past 10 years, all SMOBs have been in MCR. 
Ok man, if you say so
No offense but I don't really see your credentials.
It'd probably be best to ask Carmen.
Wait so are you seriously running?
Did you even do MCR?
Breakfast was just cereal but lunch was good
Decent
It's pretty good except the venue is kinda rachet
Yeppp
Lol
Yeah they gave me travel reimbursement lo
oops that was supposed to be a exclamation point
alright, well thanks anyways?
What's UMIACS?
peace
thanks fam
:O
its for a hackathon
nice
that's what it is i think
http://www.cs.umd.edu/location
what does css stand for
idk
its at the computer science instructional center or something
true
I'm catching a bus for something
haha
Oh I'll be gone at 9:30
I'll be at umd this friday
alright
and Lee makes us go to these talks
like the typical college "visit" thing
yeah you know
Maryland sent a guy to Poolesville the other day to tell us about it
legend
what a legned
oh true
who are you dorming with
gesterling is great
I'm doing stat notes right now hah
would*
who was of thought to do that
whoa
that man is wild
I have pulupa for bc
oh well I still don't know wtf you're talking about
what
it's so boring
I'm taking thermo
I don't understand how you like physics
we literally learned that in 6th grade with poker
wtf
doing big things
nice
in what class
lmaooo
that doesn't make any sense
how
WHAT?!?!
last night*
haha
still doing all my hw on the last day of the weekend though :/
ngl I was pretty nervous it would be a dud
It was at my house
Great
We had our first FTC meeting today
she is
oh yeah
she said you worked with her
But some african american woman really liked your group
I lied
Oh true
Shawn says you're trash
Visited Scott Key today
Yeah it's not exactly hardcore cs
The suspense was killing me 
?
And was hoping to do something with that
Ive gotten pretty alright at JavaScript
Front end and back end
I'm really into web
.____.
Or is it like a mix
Yeah but where's the cs
Jdi looks like its quantum mechanics
Ohhh
Lab as in the one from your internship?
But I should have a good foundation right?
Will I have to be good at physics?
CS and engineering?
MD?
The PI just happened to be in M
Do you remember the what you searched for?
Btw
That's the company bte
https://www.fiscalnote.com
Yeah we have to find a article every week in r&d
I see
Or will I just have to google
Is there a master list of labs
I just don't know how to get a good project
Ohhh
Common name?
But how can you find a mentor doing something really cool?
And look at what he's doing
Yeah I heard you just basically follow your mentor around
Is there a way to ensure you get a really good project?
Ill have a really bad chance of getting Intel then
I just don't wanna have a weak project at nist
But id be willing to give that up for a great project
Cause I'd have a amazing time at the private company
Tru
All the best papers are like physics and bio but I only do cs and engineering
I feel like I'd have a stronger paper at nist
Cause I can probably get an internship at a private analytics company at DC or go to nist
Is Siemens and Intel important?
Just need a 4.0 this year then
Doable 
Cause I have decent extracurriculars
What GPA would I need?
For sure
I'm really hoping Stanford but that's a stretchhhhhhhh
Oh true
So did you apply to Berkeley?
Same
Did you apply?
(Probably not)
Maybe Georgia Tech or Berkeley (if I get in)
I'm probably going to umd
Ohhh
Computer
What's computing engineering
But I heard that's impossible
I wanna do some mix of business, engineering and cs
Double?
Wait what are you majoring in again
Come back to at least one FIRST build day
I'll try
Yeah It's pretty straight forward
Yeah I guess
Going*
Goring through a electronics book and playing with arduinos
I'm thinking of reviewing the FIRST electrical guide
lmao
I kinda have to own that now and if anything fucks up, its my fault
how'd you get so good at electrical
Yo
to visit
yeah actually should come back tho
fite me fool
(not really)
you too
awwww
It's so crazy that I'm the same age now as when I first met you
k thx
??
why would she have it
I'm not even sure where to start w/ that
noooo
can you share with me pls
Do you still have the paper you wrote?
Like a bunch arrows and colors and stuff
Ok, I heard that we should try to make it as creative as possible
what do you mean?
What tips would you  give
kek
...
Got Scott Key
AYyy
Alright thanks
And I'm not nearly as good as physics as you
Do Hanson give hard tests?
Cause I just got placed in it by my counselor cause I had a conflict
Hard
Is it hars
Yo did you take thermo and quantum?
but then I see its posted by ur mum...
I always see pictures of you and wanna comment something genius on it
That'd be awesome
?
in you haha
I knew they have a good engineering school and decent comp sci
huh, i didn't know that
that's what i have
well shit
what did you have
Cause I don't have a 4.0 either so I'm just wondering
Do you think GPA was the reason?
in*
since you said if you get it
I'm guessing you were deferred ?
Did you apply for early admission @ CalTech?
Got you
how do you not know
..
Where'd you apply?
are you gonna go to umd
thanks
I don't have anymore questions haha
ight
so we're meeting weds
balls
so like now
cause i honestly don't know

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

Anyways, I was talking to Michael today and he says that they're going to be a electrical workshop sometimes this week?
Hmmm. Ok.
Hey, did you get my text?

Hey
Thanks!!!!!!

Calvin's supporting the students rights in using that technology to do things like taking notes during class.
When education becomes device-student, its like textbook learning. Completely pointless and dull. So again, I agree. 
Aiding education is not replacing the teacher. It's assisting her. 
That's true and I definitely agree in that teacher-student interaction is necessary.
Why do you oppose technology in the classroom?
I agree with you to a certain extent.

What language did you program the robots in?
Alright. Thanks for letting me know
I should be able to come
I'll have to see since I'll probably have a lot of homework
Hey, how's it been?
SMCS? I thought you go to RM? haha
oh that's right thx
what was that tool that you used to fuzz sites again
do you still have the worksheet?
Specifically Wednesday and Thursday
Hey what'd we do in McKenna's class last week?
i finished that but i wasn't 100 percent sure what Mckenna's looking for
oh true
literally the only thing i have tomorrow is physics and I'm freaking out
did you do it?
Do you have the answers?
Thanks
that's fine just send it to me when you get the time
can you send me a pic?
hey did we get a test review today in physics?
Cause raising money is supposed to be part of the process
It's okay though
Why they do this
Bruh
Sounds good
He would have been paying that money in taxes anyways
Since it's not at a direct cost to him
I'm asking cause since it's a new fiscal year, he might be willing to donate again
so it's not actually coming out of his pocket
ok good
Was that tax exceptable
Quick question about the donation that Winston's dad gave us
Since that's the average budget according to the FTC website
Let's set a goal for 2,500 this season
Oh yeah that's right
What was our budget last year?
Like a rough estimate though
That's true
Actually have weekly meetings
Yeah for sure
How much new stuff do you think we're gonna have to buy?
Who has all the parts right now?
??
First, we need to come up with a estimated budget breakdown tho
Unfortunately Poolesville is not half the city Rockville is
I was talking to Peter and he said that one of their biggest sponsors was the Rockville Rotary Club
It's a pain in the ass
Yeah, I've been looking at some grants for FRC
I have no idea how all those thumbs got sent
Exactly
Cause part of why it's so fun is cause we're friends
And we can bring on 7 underclassman
I think 8 seniors is fine
So you want the team to continye
Yeah
How many people do we have returning?
Or we bring back a lot of the same people and have to be fine with it dying out
Either we bring on a bunch of underclassman and hope that our FTC team continues
The team can go in one of two directions
You wanna meet some time for FTC?
How?
Holy shit
How do they have that much money...
What does RM do for their two teams?
Hmmm
What was a reason that we didn't want to combine funds again?
Did you have anything in mind?
Hey, what's your plan for FTC this offseason?
yeah sorry lol
I figured it out in the 5 seconds that I messaged you lol
wait
Hey did you find out a way to use fusion tables with MIT App Inventor?
nah
Yeah I'm not going to be able to
Ok
Can I call in?
I could come if you need me
No exams
Yea
I'm not going to be at school
Oof
What day?
Actually it depends where it is
Sure
I am
I think she's a sophomore ?
She goes to our school lel
Who's interviewing us?
Yeah
Alright, ttyl
I signed up to volunteer for my brother's basketball team so I'll be doing this over my phone lol
Alright, cause the 4 hour heads up time is not the move haha
Since when was Sahil sending out emails?
sounds good
tomorrow*
Do you want to talk to Croner tomorrw?
I don't necessarily want to preside for two people I just think that the seniors should get be able to get whoever they want
Whatever man, just looking out for the seniors
Being allowed to preside for more than just one person completely changes that
Yes, they asked around, everyone they asked was taken and they gave up
Because...
What is your stance?
Yeah I know but I had at least two people on that list who asked me and I had to say no cause I was already doing it for someone else
Idk man this just makes no sense to me
It's about the seniors and who they want to preside for them
Yeah it would because at the end of the day it's not about the juniors
Why does it matter?
Why?
Helllo?
Friends*
As long as there's no schedule conflict
I have some friend who still don't have a presider and I would do it for all of them
Every senior should be able to pick
This is basic logic dude
Why would it matter
Just make the schedule and then we can make sure that they're not the same time
Why not?
Can we preside for more than one person
Sounds good
Submitted an application
Please briefly describe your team's fundraising plan.
100 words
that's all it is
Please briefly describe your team's fundraising plan.
it's 100 words
that's the only thing left but everything was pretty easy since we had done it before
I'm filling out the application now
what's our fundraising plan?
yepp
I think that's more for some tiny club that's starting up
you right
I used to be MCR exec
lel
How come?
Have you submitted anything for the MCR grant?
Going to resubmit an application tonight
They said that even if you were denied before, you can apply again.
Hey Mr. Lee forwarded me an email from one of the people representing FIRST. Apparently, they have some grant money left and are looking to give it out to teams.
That looks good
Yeah
Put down ours
What do you mean
Yeah
What day did we do AMC again?
I got you
Yeah I kno
How long were you thinking of meeting for?
cool
Why wouldn't I haha
sounds good
What works best for you
Yeah sure
after school?
yeah hey
see ya
sorry
I'm kinda busy right now can I talk to you later tonight?
yeah it's all good we'll figure this out
I see
a lot of this is my fault sorry
we really gotta get cracking
good
sure that sounds
If you know what I'm saying
Just cause part of the competition is finding sponsors and getting grants
I'd prefer not to take money from Winston's dad
Cause we need money man
I'll be cold emailing for a couple hours
You guys can work on the drive train
I'm trying to get all the grants I can
It's better if I handle this end anyways
can't go today
I'll handle the paperwork
damn
stuck without a ride
for sure
I just meant the actual design haha
we can practice with one definitely
just cause it's kinda different from last year and we still need to buy some parts
that's gonna be a stretch
Drive train?
ehhhh
Yeah, its my mom's birthday and they wanna go somewhere
long
I won't be able to stay for very
cool
are you going to winstons
Are you going to winstons
Yess
You're coming tomorrow?
Hmm
I sent him a message but I haven't gotten a response
What would be the best way to contact Kevin zong
Please let me know as soon as you can so I can put a list together
Yeah
Do you want to forward them the email or are they undecided
As long as they can contribute then its all good
Who?
Yeah
A lot of people didn't do anything
...
Riley just told me I'm missing a couple people on my email
OK cool
Can you make it
Yeah I invited them over
We're combining with Winston thought right
I wanted to let you know beforehand but it was getting kinda late and I wanted to sent it out asap
Hey, I sent out a email from the FTC email account about a meeting at my house tomorrow
Wally missed a call from Glenn.
Wally missed a call from Glenn.
Wally missed a call from Glenn.
Wally missed a call from Glenn.
pls
Wally!
I'm going to schedule a meeting at my house tomorrow
And who do you want on the team other than the people we put in the ftc group chat
Did we officially combine teams with Winston?
I know but it aint jony & kent stacked
Why would I be offended lol
that's not stacked
lmao
who
I definitely wouldn't make finals then tho
butt that'd be a pain in the ass
I probably could one man
true
...
dammnit wally
not trying to one man
I'm still looking for a team
damn
Do you have a CSAW team
sounds good
we were thinking ~10
what do you think is a good number
pls add people
yeah
We were just talking about the members
did you read the ftc facebook chat?
It's gonna be tough
Yeah

Happy Valentines Day!
Congrats on the Bronze and go for the Gold! 
Hey Guys! My name is Glenn Ren and I'm a high school student in the Washington D.C. area. I absolutely loved your performance today! Alex's style is amazing and I really look up to you as one of my role models. I really wish that you had time to reply to every one of these messages but you guys have to practice. A Gold in South Korea in 4 years? haha. Go BLUE!
I just pissed cause it's really not that big of a deal
But a bunch of people spread it and I'm not looking to get in trouble
I'm on robotics team and we we're using the wifi for our robot. So we had a legitimate reason for using it.
To be honest, I'm actually pretty pissed about this
I don't recommend doing that though. Since they got suspended
Nah. They brought their own computers and plugged the desktop ether net cord into their computer s
They used a type of Linux called backtrack. Then they went into the command line
But I guess I know how to do it
I actually got the password from some Poolesville alumni.
Ahaha thanks
Anytime
No problem man
You should have got it
Alright
Is it hairs
What's
What the essay called
Lemme see
Alright
Yeah
Yeah

I don't think we're going to QO
Carmen invited me.

Yeah
Sure, no problem! You'd be a great treasurer!
I'm pretty sure it was a joke but I still loled

That wasn't me
Hey what's up
Chill out fam
He's gonna say that he's "a LeBron fan"
All nba
Wasn't that dude
It's the intangibles lol
And it depends
And Curry = Kyrie
Westbrook > kyrie
Right now I have to say kyrie
I rather wait and let the young players develop
Next year if we have a top 5 pick (Nets), we could have a superstar
We shouldn't be a win now team
They're going to give up too much to get a player for one year
I don't want russell
Praneeth would be sooo salty and Boston's suffered for too long
I'm hoping Boston knock off the Cavs this year
Are you and Kevin interning at the same place?
Your*
Enjoy you summer
Chill tho lmao
Bruh that's too funny
That's just shit posting bruh
Only time will tell
By taking the easy road out
He ruined his legacy
He should have went to Boston
That's not the point
Sell out
Lmaoooo you right
Fair point
This you?
Nevermind
I mean it's okay
Curry hasn't been playing well :/
Thompson and Draymond playing out of their minds
Ohhh I see
Do you have a npo
Your grades shouldn't have to suffer because of something she did
Yeah nice
Yeah that's fucked up man
Ohhhh
Wait i thoght it u was a group grade
So what happened?
No
That's why he avged 40 lmao

Don't worry about it
Internet lol
Don't even know what to say... The interest gives people places to hide
People got no chill man
Idek
neither can i
Its on my timeline
EXACTLY. The real king is going home
I died when I saw this
Yeah it was sick
I don't need very many pictures and I'm only a relatively tight budget since these will be my first headshots.
Probably 50/50
It's pretty low quality but it's just the general idea.
I'm looking for something like this:
I'm looking for a headshot for a acting resume so I mostly just need the head and a little bit of the shoulders.
Have you done any headshots before and do you have any samples?
Hey do you do headshots?
No problem. Good luck man
No problem. I've already voted on like 5 devices
I was just joking dude take your time
Lit 
Did you just come back from Cali?
Are FRC donations tax deductible?
Cause finalists automatically get half scholarship
I'm mostly asking for USC
That's cool
How hard is it to go from a semifinalist to a finalist
You got national merit right?
Yo
Ight cool
When you get the time can you show me how we raised money last year?
Yo
For sure
But yeah I'll hold it down
I don't know what the fuck happened that quarter, I literally did not do anything in any class
Yeah totally

Ya feel
I've just been waiting for this all day

Do you know who might?
Justin parks
Do you know Justin phone number
Are you driving
justin park bailed
alright
just saying
in my defense we should be 1-1
cause unfortunely I have a 0-2 record
yeah
can you be my official judge?
but are you any debater's official "judge"?
yeah
Are you anyone's "judge" for tomorrow?
Hey, what kind of drive train are you guys using for FTC?
I know :'(
Hey I won't be able to go tomorrow :/
Gotcha, thanks
Any updates?
Awesome, thanks!
I'm the only person on Poolesville FTC team going since most of them have the ACT
Would you mind if I hitched a ride with someone?
Is anyone from RM going to the FTC kickoff at Glenelg next week?
I'm just trying to figure out how to manage FRC and FTC finances and fundraising
Is the account combined?
For RM do you guys raise money for each of the teams separately or together?
That would be great thanks
Not that I know of
Cause we need upwards of 15k
We're having trouble finding money
True
How does RM get most of it's money?
yeah
Gotchu
Sk and I haven't been doing much outside of looking for grants and stuff
Sounds good
The thing is, we don't actually have a mentor outside of our teacher that supervises us
That'd be fine
FTC is still being figured out
Me and Seungkyoon
For FRC?
What can I do?
Yep
What's up?
Sure
I've been doing a internship, what about you?
I'm pretty good
Hey, Peter!
Hey have you heard of hackBCA?
My major that is
I'm just asking cause I trying to figure it out lol
Alright thanks
Hey what's your brother majoring in?
But Poolesville is wayyyy to small
I'm trying to have one in MCPS
Do you know what a hackathon is?
Is your FTC team associated with the school?
Alright sure, I still have some stuff to do on the presentation
See ya tomorrow!
I will thanks!
Yeah its pretty rough
At least for us
Back logging is the worst. Everything is basically BS
The most painful part of FTc
The engineering notebook
Yeah it should definitely be fun but at times it can be hard to juggle
This is my first year really running in and its FTC and FRc back to back 
Yeah I got you
Wally handled that
It's Montgomery I'm pretty sure
"Do you even lift bro?"
that's gonna be rough
Yeah haha
Tomorrow's dress code is just team T-Shirts right?
Tomorrow
I'll have to check the calendar for the exact date but I don't remember off the top of my head
that's on me
Honestly, we're not close to be as far as I'd like to be and that
Drive train and design.
Where do you guys meet?
often less
I try to work around people's schedules but if a couple people can't come the meeting is literally like 7 people
it's so difficult to find a time that works for everyone.
Ugh, it
Is it a set date and time every time?
How often do you guys meet and for how long?
We have to meet out of school as well.
Or both in school and out?
Do you guys meet out of school?
Well, it's been a bit busy the past two weeks but we make it work :)
Hey Peter!
Yeah np
Poolesville FRC's the same way
Yeah
None of us went to the kickoff but I've sent the video to all of them and read most of the important documentation
Go ahead haha
Yeah sure
Yeah it is
I'm pretty sure all 8
We had to filter out a number of people on the team last year who didn't show up to the meetings and had poor attendance
Only about 8 guys
This is going to be a relatively small meeting
And I was wondering what RM typically does
tomorrow*
I'm running our FIRST FTC meeting of the build season today
Hey Peter
What did you do for your science Montgomery project in 8th grade?
Do you guys have this?
http://www.andymark.com/FTC-Field-p/am-2969.htm
What's his email?
Alright, no problem.
Great, thanks! If you need any thoughts on it just let me know!
That'd be awesome
gonna look at more internships tho
not in particular but just got a lot of this on my plate right now
that'd be smart ^^^
i've been trying to apply to other companies but overall pretty busy right now lol
Especially if you can get a cool research project for SRP
Ah, if I were you I'd definitely do it
Assuming that meant I got a returning offer
that?*
Did you get thatv
no, just ask him lol
gotcha
I can't even sign in :/
I'm not necessary pressed cause I'll probably be somewhere else but it would definitely be nice to have
what about you?
not yet
I just get a notification everytime haha
It doesn't bother me lol
Why do you keep requesting to join groups?
Yes it is
Yes
Nice
What do you do?
Yeah
It's pretty chill too
So do you have a question or...
Why?
Yes
Why?
I'm having a lot of fun man
It's in building 2691 tho
1-3
What about every else?
Damn that sucks
I'll ask Ellen first thing tomorrow and get back to you
There wasn't anything on the calendar
Not sure
Or get a check
You can probably use your parents
Yep
You enter your bank account info on CATS
Are you on CATs yet?
They're providing lunch too
Floor #3
8:30
no
Why?
Most likely
hey what's up
?
The UMBC guys were kinda... interesting
Lol thanks
I can only imagine
Jesus
Thanks
I know some people at UMD so I'll probably just go anyways
ugh
Can you forward it to me at contact@glennren.me?
Where's the list?
What you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What?
our fourth was karan, azeem and then nick except none of them can go
and ishan
me wally
my team is flaking lol
yeah
Cause I'm a lazy ass
I'm at a point where I basically just read writeups
I feel you man
That's cool
You wanna trade writeups?
lmao same
How'd your team do?
Sorry dude but I'm kinda burnt from mcpshsf today
I'm not sure
nope
php
Yeah I think so too
I'll look at it in a sec
Nah why?
I'm probably going to be riding the bus
Are you?
yep
I'm still deciding
alright man
The team all talk to each other man
I don't remember
though*
but that's not until they go to NYU thoguh
I don't actually know I just heard
Like estep meets with the mentors of other teams I think
I'd talk to estep first
Yeah sure
but no matter how dumb it is, there's only so much we can do
of course not
they're scared
We're too good man
I seriously doubt they will since that would be unfair to the teams that had previously gotten in
problems*
and either make it one week or have better problem
just make it whoever gets the most points
exactly
especially cause they sprung the writeup on teams so last minute
and complain
there's like a huge meetup
Like fucking protest to the organizers
you can bet your ass he's gonna be all over this
estep will do his thing
relax for now
not anymore
Just talk to chris
?
Yeah I guess
imagine how pissed kent, johnny, nick and declan are
hey but you have 2 more years at least
at least
yeah I feel ya
Hackathon Hackers haha
HH?
I'm coming back from one
York
Im on a bus in new yoek
Hey whats up
Nope
Yeah, no idea who that guy is lol
why?*
no, whY?
Had it for dayss
I have an android but no nexus 9
Lol
Why

Thanks so much!
If you could*
Yeah if that'd be awesome
what did you guys do then?
really haha?
what were they cause I've been looking and haven't been able to find any lol
It's alright, junior year is a bigger struggle than I'd thought it'd be
What business clubs did you do at Poolesville?
Yo
FIRST af
...
Still a bitch
wat
what was you handle again
fine
ugh
Gimme that neck
?
what
sup
ours isnt even together yet
yeah
lmao
oh i don't remember
we have good prototypes but have to implement them still
It's pretty damn difficult
thats mostly it
yeah
PWM
it's called pulse width modulation
yeah
it's called a pwm cable
it's this
http://cdn3.volusion.com/vyfsn.knvgw/v/vspfiles/photos/am-0693-2.jpg?1420269442
the talon also has another wire going into it
and then out the other side to the motor
a power (red) and ground wire (black) goes from the power distribution board to the talon one one side
thats really bad quality but
they're a motor controller
well
yeah
here's a picture of the talons
http://www.crosstheroadelectronics.com/Talon%20SR.jpg
breakers regulate the current
horizontal black rectangles go into them call "breakers'
you see the little slots in the middle
if you look on the electrical board
we don't count him since he mostly does programming now
powers the motors
is the power distribution board
http://cdn3.volusion.com/vyfsn.knvgw/v/vspfiles/photos/am-0865-2.jpg?1420269442
/me
yogith.
big black motors = jaguars
silver and green motors = talons
i lied
silver and green motors = spikes
black=ground
red=power
let me break it down real quick
cause half are retarded
but you'd be on electrical tho
i already did

I'm so tired lol
I'm going to bed man
Cool
I've heard pretty good things about Asus Zenbooks
jesus
Do you mind me asking how it broke? o.O
What's your price range?
?
is 3.0 quad or dual
That's a good benchmark
For what?
My current laptop is discontinued but they make machines with really good specs for a relatively cheap price
I don't really play games but I'd definitely look into the Lenovo y series though
Hmmm
Why?
I don't remember the exactly specs but I'm sure it's somewhere online.
Lenovo y410p
2404048112
What do you mean
?
But I'm definitely going to Bitcamp
I might not be able to go to HackRU
Probably
I'm trying to find other public transportation
Yeah
My bad
so I don't really know right now
but we might not have anyone doing it
so idk
we have CTF teams at Poolesville
I will
Probably
Nah I just saw it
tfctf?
I've heard tough stories about the game industry
game dev is hard
Oh man
That's the plan
Biotech, physics, transportation, stuff like that
I think the future of technology isn't in computer science or programming alone but it's application to existing fields
Lol nice
Its lit 
Ayyy
Going to the same ones?
senioritis ftw
all good haha
yeah
yep hahah
And that way, I can drive home every other weekend to see the fam
I want to go there so badly
My dream college right now is UMD

Speaking of next year, how's the college search?
It's not work if you're having fun haha
I'll try not to

Oh I went with UMD

I got to talk to one of co-founders of TeeSpring and Reddit and I learned a lot from them
our project ending up falling apart but it was the most fun I've had a while nonetheless
yeah, so I went to HackTheNorth a couple weeks ago and it was pretty cool
a lot of my friends are taking it next week as well
Yeah I know
I wanna get national merit but that's probably not going to happen
PSAT
I wanted to go to HackRU this weekend but I have to stay home and study for the PST
Oh man that's a struggle
Hey I know you're probably busy with college apps  but I realized I haven't talked to you in a while!

last quarter
because I had a stupid ass 2.5
sorry I didn't respond earlier
my weird af bipolar parent not say I can't go
Hey
So if you're comfortable sitting in a car with me my brother and my parents haha
yeah
My parents surprised the hell out of me
literally said fuck it and decided to stay overnight...
like my parents can take you both ways if you want
actually it seems like my parents are planning on taking a road trip
???????
My parents can send us but can yours pick up?
Why so early
How long does it take to drive there?
You know registration is from 10-11 right
Yeah
I'm bout to stay up all night doing hw
Yeah
Idek man
Wow really?
Ik
How are we getting back
Damn
Really?
Who?
Idk
No idea
Ive been trying to find a ride
Lmao
What do you mean
Are your parents driving??
Yeah
Still don't have a way to get there
same
s
google map
gets
thats not even close to as bad as it get
lol
yeah
i've been thinking of using public transportation
lmao
"guardian"
unless we have a guardian
.___.
+ it's 18 and over
a bus?
I've been trying to get a ride to uva
i did
yeah
Yeah
Especially for a 12 hour hackathon
NY is a struggle
i can't find it
was just planning on going
no idea
Idk just show up
Whay
Hopefully
Yeah ik
we should probably email them
we still have a while
lmao
im not sure how long that'd take tho
mentor thing?
he's pretty weird
lmao
?
We gotta find some other people tho
Tru
tomorrow night is gonna be a grind
the schoolwork is real
a struggle
yo
Kkk
The registration won't allow HS students tho
Of course
I a friend that knows TJ and says I heard he's a pretty good guy
damn
dude that's not very specific
what language are you planning to write it in
sure why not
yeah
I'm using VM ware
and I'm trying to learn swift
though I've made games in python
like i said, I'm more of a front end developer for now
yeah
Do you have a lot of experience in game making?
or we could make it really hard
(this also goes for SAT scores, ACT scores etc.)
like it could be really easy if we only compare the gpa of the average person who gets in to the person who is applying
I get what you're saying but I feel like there's two ends of the spectrum to this project
wouldn't that dissuade some people from applying tho?
got it
exactly
oh lmao
extracurriculars?
i'm open to ideas
yeah
inventor?
wbu
I'm good man
hey
Lol don't worry about it
Thats what HH is for
No problem man
I'm not sure if I can yet
I know a guy up there and ive been trying to get a bus
Go to hs hackers and look at the pinned posts
Just a hell of a lot of research
I'm pretty new too
Lmao
Go to BCA
Yeah
I think all the tickets have sold out
Virginia Tech
But if we come up with a good idea I could carry the front end and you the back I guess
Im going to hackVT in like 2 weeks so I'm hoping to learn what I can there
i haven't really thought about it
Well I know some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascipt. At one point I was pretty decent at Python but its been a while. I know a minimal amount of Java but no android development
are we counting markup or not haha
sure why not
I was just wondering
nah it's fine
I'm just wondering how you know I was going haha
Idk, just wondering, how do you know me?
Hey, I'm a high school sophmore who knows some basic HTML, CSS, Python and Java + a bit of design. I've signed up for VTHacks next month but admittedly I'm a bit intimidated since I don't believe I'd be very competitive. Any tips?
Hey you're really familiar with the Boston area right?
Alright sounds good!
Just thought I'd let you know the the Venture website is down
Yo
Hey what were you reasons for dropping HS
awesome thanks!
Could you elaborate on the Skill Development portion? Like the languages, graphic design, etc.
Yeah, this one:https://leangap.com/curriculum?
Hey man, I was wondering if you could give me a better idea of the curriculum and what we'd be doing at LeanGap.
thanks
ok awesome
If I do get accepted into LeanGap, will housing be provided or will I have to find it on my own?
So thank you so much for sharing your story
I saw your TED talk and I have never related more in my life.
Hey Eddy, 
I'm a 15 year old student from Maryland and I'd like to ask you some things about LeanGap.
That'd be awesome!
For what exactly?
Not sure
I actually have no idea
you
yoy

Let me know if he recognizes it
Goyard
Dang it
I want ur body
Seungkyoon's not even in the video and he did the most smh

Karl has probably done more physical activity than me this summer
I swear
well in that case, a less round shape
I should really try to get back into shape
yep
total
I've run 3
I started the summer telling myself that I was going to run 5 miles a day
same haha
I try to force myself to go outside but it never works
this summer I've literally gained 10 pounds from just sitting in the house
true
Praneeth told me justin was taking weight training haha
oh tru
isn't health bs anyway?
that's fucked up
aren't one of those only offered every two years?
damn dude

What did you ask?

they said we couldn't get it yet right?
nah
tru
I'm not sure
What are you wearing to zoya's thing

hello?
are you calling 2404048112?
i didn't get it
hm
I'm thinking 30 minutes?
How long would you like to talk?
Yeah sure, what time is good for you?
?
I also have a venue in mind haha
I'd love to take the time to organize it!
:'(
Or that of whomever is organizing CodeDay in the Spring?
Hey do you have Viet Nguyen's contact info?
Yeah, I know what you mean. No matter how I felt I shouldn't have tweeted that and I see how one could find it offensive. It wasn't directed at a beginner but someone who scoffed at the idea of me joining their team. Not a justification, just thought I'd let you know the circumstances.
I didn't think I was telling anyone to kill themselves or anything like that.
Hey, Viet showed me the messages you sent him and my bad, I shouldn't have tweeted that.
I know it's not much but next time I see you, lunch or whatever is on me. Keep grinding man! Really wish I could do more. I understand how tough times can be and no matter what happens keep your head up 
Hey happy birthday man!
Hello?
Hey dude, do you still have the excel spreadsheet of upcoming hackathons?
I applied to HackDuke and I got in except they only accept undergrad and higher.
Have you gone to hackathons that don't accept HS students?
:/
Yeah I feel. He's in DC right now and its like all hell broke loose. 
Are you going to Baltimore Innovation Week?
Or host it in a county about 50 minutes away
I can either combine my local Hack Day with umd
Well right now Im stuck between two places
Do you help organize a Local Hack Day?
Too lazy to stay at a hotel
Are there any places in Philly that developers can stay 24/7
Hey, what companies do you typically ask for money from for FIRST?
thanks anyways
It's all good
cause I've heard of it before but I've never actually used it, but I'd like to incorporate it into a project that's due tomorrow
Are you familiar with Parse
for us its competition
cause we have to give a "speech"
any importants topics to bring up?
haha
I know you're pretty involved with FIRST so I was wondering if you had any tips
Hey, I'm going to be running for next years captain of my FIRST robotics team
that's why I'm asking
ik
Are you going to be doing colorwar this year?
What are so good site with resume templates?
Cause I have a potential venue except they asked what hosting this event would require from them
Besides their facility of course
What does CodeDay need from the venue
thanks
ahh I see
idek
apparently its added by default
divs have a weird space in between them
yeah
nevermind I got it
in html
you know how there's this random space between divs?
hey
IK I was wondering if it was one of those hackathons you could BS your age to
Are you going to Seoul?
Poker with dad lol
Shit my bad
Jkjk
Beat em
Right now the only way students find CTFs is though mouth to mouth and emails
A CTF league would be dope as heck
6 hour each way....
that's a struggle cause that's how long it'll take me both ways
Ugh
Is ironhacks only 12 hours?
I am based on the best coast of the US of A
Hey, if I'm interested in joining the Ignition team should I email hello@hsignition.com or can I communicate with you on here (I find it more personal)?
Poolesville in Maryland
See ya soon
Alright
I just got up
I've kinda been moving around. I guess I'm not technically "hacking" lol
Alright
Hey you were explaining something to me earlier about LinkedIn and I forgot what it was
And just wondering, how would you recommend me start learning android dev
I'll try it!
Back ?
I can't find something good online
yeah
how would I make something like this
Alright
oh nevermind
Yo are you busy right now?
happy birthday man
I don't actually need passwords
Like there will be a teacher account and a student account where a teacher makes the poll and a student votes
Can I make two different types of accounts?
and cast their vote
It just a voting system where students log in w/ their student id
I want to make a web app
how do you use parse to make accounts?
yeah, I'm just really interested in where it's gonna be cause it has the potential to be fucking amazing
idek how it gonna work
I hoping to go too (ask a "camper")
are you thinking about being a counselor @ Hackfund's camp
if they don't let me in, I might just do that
lol
I'm only like 30 minutes away so its not a big deal
yeah pretty much
nah
its over 18 but I heard they don't really care
well hopefully
Yeah
You're going to bitcamp?
It's in CT but I just wanted to make sure its fake cause if it wasn't that'd actually be pretty dope
posted about that node.js workshop in baltimore,
I know you
Nothing just at GM for FIRST robotics and remembered you went here haha
Patriot center
Yeah. School is a struggle
I'm not sure I can either
Damnn
Wait whattt
thanks though
probably but I haven't found anything yet
darn ok
found anything yet or are you gonna drive
-50 reimbursement
If we buy round trip thats $60
I mean that's not terrible
I haven't checked that yet
I've been looking at public transportation and apparently it takes 5 hours by that
Ah I see
Do you know anyone else driving there?
I see
I thought there was a $50 reimbursement? \
I'll split the gas money but I can't drive haha
You have a car?
Hey how are you going to UVA?
ohh i see
what do you mean by that?
beta testing?
Hey when will details w/ Hack Camp be out
I don't mean to bug you but I was wondering when the summer program info was gonna be out haha
Any updates on that HS summer program?
What do you mean by dev shop?
When I see a Lamborghini all I think of is how many underprivileged kids you could feed with that money
Not*
No because I want to buy a nice car or a huge house but because I want to help others with that money
Money matters a ton to me
And if I'm honest with myself I'd love to make some money
I'm ridiculously competitive
I really enjoy communicating and interacting with others
Yeah np
?
I don't mean to write an essay but I understand that you're pretty experienced and I was looking for some tips
I having trouble deciding my identity in the tech field and what I want to do
leading meaning county sga, and school sga president
So, I'm not the best programmer, I like it but I don't want to become a software engineer. I enjoy communicating with others and leading.
Ok
hey man can I ask you some questions?
How much would it cost cause I'd have to fly from Maryland. #eastcoastbeastcoast
Where would it be?
Any updates on that HS hacker camp you were talking about?
haha
I'm wary about getting in the car of someone I don't know though
I'd be willing to split the gas money
how are you planning on getting there?
yes
montgomery county
I'm still looking for a way
Hey man, are you going to hackUVA?
I'm not sure I just felt like I needed to tell you cause it would be messed up if they actually did something
Certain rules
I just heard rumors that they broke rules
I don't want to be a "snitch" but you might want to look in PHS Absol
Hey man
it's not an "about me" app 
i mean not really weird but different
the format is all weird
Are you doing WWDC this year?
Yooo
leggo
Bitcamp?
Damnnn
Hey are you going to HackBCA
K
Wat

Npnp
Alright
Nahhh
Two packs cost the same as the big cups
How'd you get in astronomy night?
What apps have you made?
badass
You got the WWDC scholarship right?
Yeah a lot of people have said the best way learn a language is just to pick a project
thanks
How would I start with iOS dev
you're saying*
but yeah I get what you
I'd have my HS diploma
I'm considering working on getting enough credits to graduate
i'm a junior right now and I
Yeah that's a struggle
Cause I'm thinking about graduating early this year.
What led to you dropping out?
Thanks anyway
Dang that sucks
yeah easily
Part time?
I literally live right next to dc and do front end
I'd apply if I didn't have to go to school haha
Why do you guys need a front end dev?
HOLY SHIT
Happy birthday!!!
Do we have the same birthday?
Wait.
Yeah no prob
Yeah I didn't even go up
Popcorn
Where you at fam
Tyson's mall food court?
Oh yeah that makes more sense
Cause don't you live in Maryland?
How far do you live from DC?
Hmmm
Which city are you in?
Do you know of a website that gives you automatic facebook likes
Yo
are you busy right now?
And I want to use it but I've never actually played around with it before :)
I have a project due tomorrow
Hey have you used parse
It was Daniel Park I think

Right thanks
Was it chill or nah
How'd you get through
Side*
I'm still outsife
Are you here yet

I only have a school ID and it says 10th grade on it haha
You're in MD?
I was thinking prob not but I didn't wanna be fucked
hey I saw that you were going to bitcamp, do you think they're gonna check ids?
what you mean
lmao
what's the best way to start ios dev
coolio
You made the WWDC scholarship last year right
Hey
Glenn Ren called Anuraag Yachamaneni.

StillV

For some reason they gave me travel reimbursement and I was just like I'll take it
I'm flying lol
Hey you're going to MHacks right?
?
Cause I know a bunch of people that are interested but are too busy during the school year
?
Which one
Damn
Are you running DCHacks again this year?
Yo
they as in who?
signed up?
apparently someone from palantir went to TJ to talk a while ago
maybe
not sure what it was then
the recruiter that was there
yeah, that's what I thought
apparently there are people at TJ who do a mentorship at palantir
oh yeah i went to the one in august
what's that?
like TJ
what's the thing that you guys have with palantir?
oh yeah that's right
aren't you a 2nd semester senior though lol
It's was pretty nice
Why didn't you go to HackTJ?
Yo
thanks!
I have a interview w/ Northrop Grumman monday though
not yet
alright well thanks anyways dude
I see
What is needed in working year round?
I understand
dDid you get the chance to talk to anyone at ID.me about interns?
Yo
That's cool
I'm trying to apply everywhere and hoping something sticks
Do you know if they still have any internships open?
How was your internship at ID.me?
yeah
Same, I'm not even a fan but it'd be nice if the playoffs went through DC
Redskinsss
?
do I need a cover letter or nah
nice haha
what did you write in your emails?
I'm thinking about going to a bunch of DC tech events to network
what companies did you email?
yeah
or in the area
but they'd prefer that it's in dc
just me
my parents are ehh about maybe moving for the summer
something of the sort
like fiscalnote for example
I don't want to work at a tiny startup but more of a established one
I see
so just cold email?
Cause on my resume it literally says high school student
What do I put then?
cause no one actually wants a high schooler cause they think we don't know shitt
I've been briefly looking into internships and it's been rough
Yeah
damn, that must have been really tough haha
Thanks, I showed him this and he'll probably be using c9 at his next hackathon
I thought I had replied to this my bad
Huh
I sent him a friend request
damn
I see
what makes shrey qualified btw. I'm just wondering what they're looking for
yeah
talked*
I talk to the representative from FiscalNote and he said that they've had high school students entering college intern there
that's it?
oh true
why didn't he get in again
alright thanks
and who was the guy who applied to FiscalNote
yeah like compared to other ones it sucks
I went to the one before that one
I didn't go to the one in the spring
for?
btw who was the person you said applied to FiscalNote
and I want to make it not completely rachet this year
I've been talking to the organizer
have you gone to codeday?
that bus ride is going to be a mission
Same
I know TJ has a bus
Are you going to Hack the North
Does HackGT accept high school students?
the workshops were really cool also
Yeah it seems really hard to get people from companies to actually come
especially considering it was a lot of people's first hackathon
Venue and the food were both great but there wasn't many mentors
dchacks was really dope
yeah np
158 and 12 hearts
thought it was pretty cool
Metryx was a staff pick!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sdTq0ZxZZg
like tj students
i heard it was mostly students
Did you go?
I wanna have a hackathon at my school except were mostly cybersecurity focused
How did hackTJ work
Alright thanks
What hardware is there gonna be
Are you still up?
Yo
Thanks for checking
Ahhh got it
Hey, I thought I registered for DCHacks but no confirmation email was sent to me and I still keep getting DCHacks emails telling me to register. How would I verify that?
alright gn man
just asking cause I might know them
who?
nobody really seems to know poolesville
haha
you actually know what that is?
I go to Poolesville in Md
It said former student
lmao
Former student at TJ?
August in DC is the best
YESSS
website?
you organize hackdc?
Hi, does DC Tech Meetup allow minors?
Hey, how'd the internship search go?
And I heard Justin Bh. has something going also but its in LA
Its technically directed at "beginners" but I'd still like to go
by zach latta?
and I'm looking to airBnB but my parents wouldn't let me live alone
Cause HackCamp is at 44 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94105
Alright
Where in Cali are you staying
yeah
3 hours a day
I did FRC this year too
yeah
no one's really dedicated though so very few actually show up to meetings
yeah I just started an ftc team at my school this year
frc?
ftc?
wait you do first?
ok
working on that website too
but I've been coding for a lot longer
I've known what hackathons are for like a month
I'm in the process of finalizing it
And the school is 40 minutes away so I get home at 5
I have 8 classes
SAME
it's so frusterating
that really shoves biology down my throat
I'm in this STEM program
but*
bus 3-4 hours a night isn't fun
me too
just a ton of busywork
school has just been a pain in the ass recently
i see
what mit classes did you take though
true true
of course we'd need to get an internship first
then we could split the cost
if we could get a group out to cali
what are your planned living arrangements cause I've just been looking for internships in the DC area
suppose you do get in
ahhh
what company was this for?
like how do you measure that
how?
haha
they're all just stuck in a mindset
so I feel ya
I've been looking for internships over the summer also but I'll always email them and they tell me college only
yooooo
my*
Nothing much, just going to calendar and working at ny internship
I didn't think they were actually gonna use that part of me talking
Thanks lol
how come?
dude that blows
Got it
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
Yo can you forward the bitcamp emails to me?
Gonna figure this out
Weird
I'll have to ask about it
Shit
I didn't get it
Huh
See ya at bitcamp then
Good stuff
I'm going to hackBCA tomorrow
I still have no idea what I'm going to do at bitcamp though
Not sure
It's closer too
I'll be at bitcamp
Oh true, that's cool too. Can't wait to see ya there
Are you going as a mentor?
Yeah
Tomorrow?
Almost there
Didn't end up bringing my Wii :/
Sorry I'm running a bit late
Around 1 probably
Awesome, sounds good!
Like what's the meal situation for volunteers?
As a volunteer, will I be able to buy food?
Cool
Will the TV work?
See ya. Thanks!
Alright
What's the link again(I'll try to login)?
I thought I had
More as a volunteer since I wasn't planning on submitting a hack
Tickets are sold out

I could bring in a WII or something
Idk
Presentations

Have you asked him
Do you know Michael Bailey
Oh yeah I forgot
Have you asked Jeroen
Have you gotten any sponsors?
Yeah i might
we probably want to start cold emailing soon
ok sounds good
Have you found any sponsors?
Yo what's going on with CodeDay?
First time hearing that
Really not sure what they're asking
Weird
Hmmm
Its basically a function
Or define as in computer science definition
Like define a method in code
In what context
Yeah Isaiah tweeted a picture
Wanted to go but it was 18+
Ok cool
ofc the more the better
Someone from StudentRND recommended at least 2 sponsors
alright
have you tried looking for a different venue?
One last thing
etc.
snacks
sponsors
food
just planning everything out
or at least for this codeday
cause I'd really love to help plan this year!
can we make a google doc this weekend
alright
and i'm curious to what it's spend on
how much money did we get from sponsors last codeday
okay cool
what do we need to do in terms of finding sponsors?
like the big parts that need organizing
What are the main logistical components?
what's going on w/ codeday

I know a guy who owns a startup in dc
Yeah np

ah I see
Oh like since Tyler said you were busy
What?
Yeah I talked to Tyler about organizing it since there wasn't a DC event.
Will do!
Hey Tim! I know you're the CEO and aren't really involved in the trivial tasks at FiscalNote but I found a couple of grammatical errors in the company's White Paper that I downloaded off the site.
Hi again, any luck?
Thanks! 
Hi Tim, I saw that FiscalNote was going to be at HoyaHacks this weekend. They sent out a email saying that you guys were giving out an API prize which led me to stumble upon https://fiscalnote.github.io/FiscalNote-API/. Unfortunately, they don't allow any students under the age of 18 so I was wondering if somehow I could still receive an API key to work with.
Hey Tim!
Yeah, sure. Thanks so much!
Even if it is getting coffee and copying papers
Hey, I was wondering whether you offered interships for high school students?
What's up man?
Are you going to abbys
Yo
what's gonna be on the thermo quiz

nbd
Just wondering
Yeah np
Are you going to do the script?
Hey man, we need to get all the ESS done by Friday
When is it due
You know if we turned in the "Innovate to Mitigate Contest Entry"?
Alright thanks
Alright cause physics is not one of my strong points at all
Really? So I don't need to prep or anything?
I thought Hanson was legit
How come
Yeah
Cause I just got placed in it by my counselor cause I had a conflict in my schedule
Is it hard?
Yo did you take thermo and quantum?
Thanks
Alright

I'm not trying to get behind
what was the classwork today
idk sohn hasn't taught anything these past two days has he?
I've been out for the past two days
idek what's happening man
Continuous i think
Fourier analysis anyways
Yeah
but I know a bit of lin alg
basically finished bc calc
I'm looking for a good introduction
do you still have the slides or a good learning source?
Didn't you give a talk about quantum computing a while back?
Yo
Hey are you doing Cyber Metropolis?
Ehh with JavaScript and decent with python and Java
Pretty good HTML css
?
for javascript
Because I know HTML, CSS, kinda JavaScript, Java and python
What's the way you approached it language wise (what did you learn 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.)
cause poolesville has a ok computer science program but they don't teach me any of the skills that I'd use at Hackathons
Hey, I know you said you're self taught so I was just wondering what sources you used
?
what did you guys build
Like what you won
just looked at the challengepost and that prize was ridiculous
wow
what was the prize for?
you won it from hackPrinceton right?
alright thanks
nicee
sorry
ok I just asked him and he won't be able to top that
btw this isn't for me but for a friend who could be interested
damn thats a pretty good price
Hey, I was just wondering how much you were looking for the Titan X
sure I'll give it to you tomorrow
No I haven't how much was it?
So sorry about that!

Huh
The CEO of Github is going to be there
It's one of the best HS hackathons
You can apply to HackBCA here: http://hackbca.com
Hey are you still interested in going to a hackathon?
are you going to the java programming competition on friday
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
Hey, I saw in HH Free Stuff that you had a Inbox invite, I was wondering if you still had it.
Alright thanks
?
What was your "intended major" when applyingv
Hey you're a double major right?
Alright thx
Cause I'm wondering if I can just intern for a professor during the weekends
Even for research?
Like do they come in?
maybe this is a dumb question but do college professors work on weekends?
yo
without being an absolute geeekkk
I'm just trying to go super hard in college
Can I self study that?
Shittt
What's 150?
I heard I can test out of the 100 and 200 CS classes
What majors?
So I don't have to take English 101 and Calc 2
People have told me to get a 5 on AP Lang and AP Calc
Yeah I was talking to Brandon and he says school's pretty easy
How's Maryland
I just started SRP haha
I'm still at Poolesville
For what?
Actually it was more like I did SGA and he just never came lmao
Yeah I did SGA with him back when he was in high school
Sean Bae
Tons of students from Stanford and UCs
Yeah I saw
I was looking through the list and I was like wait I know that guy
Congratss
You're a KPCB fellow?!?
Yoooo
Alright thanks
Yo did you take thermo and quantum?
yea
UMD has a bus going
yeah
oh alright
Did you apply to hack the north?
What would you even do for that
Lmao
Did you ever end up going to Bitcamp?
i can't type
lol ok
p0p 0o
why
WHAT
I love the colors though
haha what is this
I think so though since we're finishing up presentations from the last news article.
that's the one thing I forgot to put on my agenda haha
not sure
I need to get that too haha
Shit
No I don't 
Justin might
We only had two others and we referred another group for both
Sorry we're all out
ight
sorry bout that
show them the screenshot
I don't know what happened
I sent it to him
Lol
I literally have a time stamp showing that I sent it to him
it's ok
no
I'll handle it
No
moved
I've rescheduled it to next week
No
No
I emailed her but she has not responded yet
We're probably gonna meet on friday
we're like a poor man's TJ
Our school has a pretty good cs program
oh
we're a powerhouse in cyber and we have two robotics teams but the maker's club seems a bit different
cause I'm trying to see if there's a place for a maker's club at my school
ok cool
*link
tag pls
I was wondering what you do at your innovator's club at your high school
hey
but tru
and lists
you were talking about arrays
an interface lol
we weren't
we we're really talking about content haha
lmao
Thanks! Hope it goes well!
Sorry haha
Had to pick MHacks or Hack the North
Oops forgot to update. I'm not going to be able to go.
Hey Zach still hasn't responded. What should I do?
Cause I'm trying to plan my summer out (No rush!)
When will we know if we were accepted or not
Hey are you guys doing acceptances for HackCamp based on session?
If there are other applicants that are coming from out-of-state, is there a way that we organize a shared AirBnb
I definitely will!
But I'll be in California for segmented periods of time this summer
Yeah cause I live on the east coast haha
How would living arrangements work? or would we have to find that on our own?
Yeah I know
You said 8 students?
Hey, I saw you post about hackEDU and wondering what that learn to code summer program was?
I heard that this was targeted toward locals but I'd still love to come
Hey, I'm interested in Hack Camp but unfortunately I'm on the east coast (Maryland). I talked to Jonathan Leung about using AirBnb but I was wondering if you had any alternatives?
Nah that's cool, we expected that most of the seniors we're gonna be gone but thought we'd send the invite over anyways
How was our booth's location at last year's Poolesville day?
Yo
Got them thanks 
I understand they're personal though
I'm just curious about what they're looking for
Do you still have any of your essays?
True
I could also list everything on the common app
To show that hey, although my grades arent amazing, I feel like I would fit at this school and this is why
I know but just distinguish myself in some way in the first round
Plus my test scores are pretty high
The thing is though, I don't have the highest GPA but I do a lot of stuff outside of school
Indian numbers haha
I have to get past the first round first don't I lol
Do you have any advice on what they're looking for that's different from other colleges?
Sure that'd be great
I've been reading up on it and I really like the environment and the way the school is structured
Gotcha
So I'm guessing you didn't get past the second step?
True
You got into Olin right?
I will!
Thanks so so so much
Are you sending out the FIRST email tonight?
Yo
$30
for the hoodie?
I'd pay more for really nice quality but that's just me
That would be cool
nice
Sweaters would be cool as long as it's not shitty quality
I'd say it depends on how it looks but I'd probably buy it either way
Are we going to have a booth at the club fair
I think that'll still be fine
I saw
Alright
Yeah just let me know as soon as you can so I can prep a bit
Yep
Looks good
Alright
What do I need to do
What time?
Here now
No one else is here?
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
don't you have my email?
yeah
We lost a lot of the mechanical team this year
Got it I was just kinda confused 
Who's Jeremy Rubin?
Got home really late last night
Haha yeah definitely
Now
Sorry I'm responding so late but when are you available cause I free right noe
?
thanks
Alright got it
Just chilling at the library
Yeah
Well shit
Yeah
I live in Gaithersburg so I'm actually like 10 minutes away from rockville
yeah np
Hey the AP Lang presentation is due friday
Hey, I was wondering how majoring in physics in college led you to become a software engineer?
Yeah that's him. Thanks
I forgot his name. Do you know him?
Hey I one the guys I talked to at CodeDay DC said he knew you since he moved he from Seattle recently
we?
damn how much was the plane
Did you just go to San Fran for the Thiel summit
I live in maryland though so not sure about living arrangements
Yeah, ik
I know Justin Brezhev is organizing something but it's still not final yet
I'm thinking about dragging my lazy ass out of the house this summer
Ahh
Just chillin in San Fran?
Are you @ HackCamp?
friday*
Frriday
magnet
nah
It's been alright, busy as heck at Poolesville but it's a lot of fun
Hey man, what's up?
:P
I've always viewed school attendance as more of a suggestion than a requirement
Tickets are sold out though
Not sure
Early next month
can't go
I got a ticket to TechCrunch Disrupt's hackathon in NYC
I can't do one for the rest of the year
Most of the good ones are
That's the dream
They have a huge hacker community and a lot of them literally go to hackathons every weekend
Where are you going next year?
I ride up with UMD to a lot of them
A lot of the ones I do aren't in Maryland
I don't think so
No idea
Yeah that was an accident
Oops
Joel missed a call from Glenn.
Idk
I think what they meant is that you're on the waitlist but they hope that other people will realize that they can't go so you'll be moved off the waitlist and admitted
Hmmm
Or register
When did you apply
But that's usually a formality
I got one about being under 18
This?
Hold up let me check
Like a month ago
Yes
thanks!
we have it tomorrow and there are way too many words
alright thanks
bless
like was it super in depth or shallow?
do you remember how hard it was?
for the quiz
yeah
Did you guys have to do a rhetorical terms quiz last year?
yeah np
I literally wander the school in the morning
yeah
where are you in the morning
uh
oh true
yas
vote for us pls
http://innovate2015.videohall.com/posters/614
Yeah, gnight
Alright
That's really awesome! MCPS is arguably the best county in the country so it hard to see that we're "behind" some others when it comes to hackathons
I've gone to a couple of hackathons and a CodeDay and everytime I come back from one all the other students seem really excited about it but the teachers are a humongous influence
The main problem with our school is that our computer science teachers pretty old fashioned so its difficult convincing them to push hackathons
CTF stands for Capture the Flag check out
Poolesville is really into computer science (obviously) but its mostly online CTFs and cybersecurity
Yeah I know Rachit is
Is there a large group of people interested in hackathons at Richard Montgomery?
that's crazy
jesus christ
How come?
Ohhh
I looked it up and isn't it usually the test graders?
haha ok how would one even do that though
ok thanks
game?
haha yep
cause those are my main weaknesses
How should I prepare for vocab and writing though
got it
So are all my old books useless?
How are the PSAT and SAT different though?
Ohhh thanks!
IIRC?
How would you recommend prepping for it?
Yeah thanks!
(I'm gonna be taking the SAT next spring)
Does it actually matter?
Hey, I'm a sophomore prepping for the PSAT this fall?
Alright, just hit me up if anything comes to mind
You don't need me to bring anything?
That works, so that should be good right?
3 people
Sure, I'm working with a bunch of kids from UMD but they should be cool
That's cool that you guys are still friends
Oh I didn't know that
What about you guys?
Yeah I'm not sure yet
There are two buses
UMD Bus
Do you want me to bring cupcakes?
18 is much more important than 17 haha
Nah, that's cool
I know right?
I'd love to help however I can
Isaiah and I were talking about how we had the same birthday last year 
Thanks haha
Yeah!
Thanks!
Alright that works too
Not me
Hey did you get the email of the person who organized the Dingman pitch competition?
Sorry I was asleep so I'l be right there!
Yeah I just got here
Alright looks good
You know what's happening with MongoDB? Lol
Alright
Now
How'd you guys do
You did Cyberpatriot right?
Np
I got everything except the jerkey
I actually stopped here to get something haha
I'm at a CVS
Do*
What so you want?
WHAT
Nice
I'll might be able to run OSX on a vm
Not a mac but if you guys want to do iOS it's cool
Like web, phone, game or whatever
Do you know what you wanna work with?
Sounds good
Really sorry cause I know you guys have been waiting
5:20?
I went home to take a shower
I know I saw their tweet on Twitter
I'll be there at 4:30
Sorry I'm running late
Nah
Nope :\
There's actually no point on sleep depriving yourself
Yeah
Yeah I know haha
RIP
4 at the latest
I'll probably be getting to TJ a little late on Saturday
Maybe they'll have API prizes
Nah
How would that work?
Ideazz
Did you think of anything?
Yooo
foodddd
I saw the AppleTV on snapchat
dang looks good
what was your project?
niceee
from where?
I know a lot of kids at TJ though
nah
How was PennApps?
alright
sounds good
Yeah
At a Girls Computers Science event or something
pak
Alexis told me she saw you the other day haha
That's the plan!
Oh you're doing the new one?
Have you taken it yet?
I know :(
It's the same weekend as SATs
Nope
"3 steps" lololol
Yeah exactly
And get as much stuff done as i can
The organizer asked me if I could help out so I'll probably just run around the entire time
I will!
In the rooms
I'm kinda a hermit so I was upstairs last time
Yeah I know. It's nice but tiny
I asked the organizer and so far 31 have signed up
It's fun in it's own sad way
It usually is haha
Hopefully this year will be as ratchet as usual
I guess I've missed out 
I can't wait
Oh god
Is he going?
Ahahaha
Yessir
Yep! I'm really excited about it!
Going to Hack the North this Friday tho
Nah
Oh yeah I should probably do that
They haven't opened signups yet
Yeah
Meetup
Truee
HackDuke is the same weekend
Probably
?
In November
Yeah I wouldn't want to go just to see demos haha
Cryptic
Never mind, they just got back to me
I sent them a email asking if they were accepting hs students but they haven't responded
when it comes to computer science, there's not much that isaiah don't know lol
I definitely know the feeling hahaha
Yeah, I don't actually know how popular cordova is
But that's impossible
Whatttt
Thanks! I'll upload them to github and see what I can do! 
#teamswole
Lol typical Isaiah
Same, it was really great!
yeah sure np
Hey, for some reason I still can't see your code on GitHub. Can you send it to my email?
Alright
I'm running a bit late
Still driving
that's true
Yeah I guess they didn't get permission for us to stay overnight
for some reason it's split up into 2 days
alright cool, just signed up!
have you signed up yet
No I don't. Do you know how many people there'll be?
You?
I don't have anything in particular in mind
Something like MEAN
Same but I've been trying to learn the full stack
Sounds good, what's your stack?
Yeah it was! He won't be able to make Pilot right?
Yeah sure! I was just with Isaiah at DCHacks this weekend
What's your h/o
how much you want for your 6s?
how much you want for your 4s?
Alright thanks
Ohhh so I don't need to prep or anything?
Cause that's the only science I'm taking this year
Do I need like a serious background in science?
Cause I just got placed in it by my counselor cause I had a conflict
Is it hard?
Yo did you take thermo and quantum?
do you think they'll really enforce the 18+ rule?
dang
Hey are you still running Bitcamp?
The thing is, it's so hard for HS students to find internships since most companies think we're incompetent.
I'm not trying to be stuck with a dead project this summer, plus I feel like the atmosphere would be a lot more casual at a DC tech company.
Alright, so I got a offer from Northrop Grumman today but they can't specify what project I'd be working on for "security reasons".
Can I ask you some questions about internships?
Yo
Awesone, thanks!
Hey, I usually prefer to bus up to hackathons with UMD but I have no way of finding out when UMD is getting a bus. Do you organize this?
we'd still have to pay to use their facilities
yeah, that's true
I've thought about doing that but having in MoCo encourages more students from MoCo to come
Hey, I'm a high school student in Maryland and I was wondering how you implement good design into a presentation
What's your opinion of that vs a research internship at nist?
Flask, django etc
But at the private company I'll be able to do more stuff that I like (front and back end dev)
But I won't really have a paper
Cause I have a good chance of getting a internship at a private company in DC called FiscalNote
Oh OK 
Did you do CS?
Where did you do your SRP internship at??
Thanks anyways!
I've already asked a couple and they said they had no idea haha
Is there a company that would be able to provide me both?
The problem is, I really want to work at a place where I'd be able to create something.
So my teachers are recommending that I get an research internship at a place like NIST or Northrop Grumman so I'll be able have a project to submit to Intel (ISEF).
Awesome!
Hi! I'm a high school student at Poolesville High School in their Science, Math and Computer Science program. Every year, juniors from our school are required get an internship and submit what they worked on to the Intel Science Talent Search. I googled "computer science internships for high school students" and an article from your old blog popped up (http://tessrinearson.com/blog/?p=483). I have some questions and were wondering if you had the time to answer them.
See you tomorrow!
Awesome
Ok
You*
Are yo coming tomorrow?
Just let me know as soon as you can so I can put together a list
It'd be awesome if you could
Alright
Are you able to make it?
That's cool
Hey did you get my email?
Get better!
Yeah
Hmmm weird
I sent you this like a month ago...
Hey did you get my email?
Gotchu
glennren
Yeah
I'm thinking of soloing
Maybe
Hmmm
I'm just wondering if they took us off the list though :/
I just messaged them
Sorry!
Meant to message you back
Shitt
Alright cool
I'm probably just gonna message the organizers on facebook
I want to
And harshal told me you said hi lol
I'm not sure if they're really enforcing it or if it's just a formality
Yeah
I went the bitcamp last year and it was kickass
Bitcamp ftw
Yeah I probably will
How would I go about telling them haha?
I applied to HackDuke and I got in except they only accept undergrad and higher.
Hmm, is it a dick move to go to a college hackathon that only undergrad+
Idk what im gonna do
True
Yeah idk whats going on
They said they would update me later?
Yeah I got accepted but I might not be able to go
Yeah but I won't be going
Yeah it's a struggle
I applied early so I got in but I probably can't go
But I have. The psat coming up
I really want to go to hackru
But haven't heard a response yet
I applied
Really excited see ya tomorrow
Bus
Yeah I am
It's not only cyber but I'd say that's where the focus is
alright thanks!
I'm more interested in becoming a developer so I was wondering what you did while at poolesville (in terms of cs)
in the past two/three years we've become really cyber
so in January I went to my first hackathon at Virginia Tech and thought it was the coolest thing ever
Hey, I'm a Junior at Poolesville High School in SMCS. I heard you were our CS club captain a couple years back and I was wondering if you had the time to answer a couple questions.
What are you planning on going to next?
Dang. I really liked the Hack for good philosophy. Thanks anyways. 
hey do you know if hack duke is open to hs students?
that's cool, thanks
and I talked to one of their representatives about it
Yeah cause they had a booth at HackTJ
What's the program Palantir has with TJ?
true, gotta take the SAT lol
Hey were you at HackTJ?
one as a engineer for the summer and one as a part-time engineer for the spring
I applied for two positions
Mine seemed automated
At least you got a personal email though
Dang that's nice
What time does TJ start?
The struggle was real, I was really hoping to go there this summer. Oh well, maybe next year
Got a rejection email from FiscalNote :/
Oh yeah haha, Rushi told me he was part of them
Do you know who's organizing HackTJ?
Alright thanks
How could I contact him?
Ahhh ok
Arthur?
Are you planning on interning there this summer?
Could FiscalNote do anything? I know and understand that they have a process as well but I'm just wondering if I could speed it up somehow
I'll try that
The thing is I got an offer from Northrop Grumman, but I only have two weeks to respond.
Awesome!
Hey
The above one, sorry!
I applied to their software engineering intern position online but it'd be awesome if it came from you!
Could you pass my resume to the founders?
Hey
Hey how do you think this is?
Thanks so much for the help! Before winter break, I'll finalize everything and if you could forward my cover letter and resume letter to the company that would be amazing!
content?
and what about for cover letters?
nice
like class president?
in terms of content on my resume what do you think is lacking
alright
I just kinda threw it together a couple days ago
this is my resume
http://glennren.me/resume.pdf
what do you mean
So close yet so far
Yeah, I'm thinking about picking that up again
that was pretty devastating as a 7th grader
I did ACSL in middle school but I ended up getting 6th on my schools team
Haha yeah
I go to Poolesville high school and we have a SRP like TJ I think
got it thanks!
Yeah, I saw a link in HH and I downloaded the PDF
I'm taking that class right now haha
I'm thinking about doing USACO and ACSL again
factor*
what do you mean about emphasize that age isn't a facot
that's what I'm hoping
like flask
I know some python but not python for web
That's a little more
I http://glennren.com/
I'm mostly Front-End (Javascript), I'm learning "back-end" (MySQL), Flask and I'm pretty fluent in java
there's my github
https://github.com/GlennRen
Yeah, so I wouldn't say I'm super impressive
I got into the hackathon community a little less than a year ago and that's really when I begun interested in computer science
I see, I'm definitely willing to put in the hours
junior
I'm hoping to know what they're looking for in a intern and how I'd get a better chance
I know FiscalNote does a lot with NPL and Machine Learning and I'm really trying to learn
Oh, I see. Anuraag sent me the link to your LinkedIn and honestly I don't think I'm there yet
Why didn't you intern there?
Alright
Yep! MoCo represent
county*
The founders graduated from my country haha
I still have some stuff I'd like to do
Yeah I am, he told me you applied?
I wanna do a lot of things and only have time for so much
It's all good!
Somewhat
I feel like I'm on the verge of burning out spectacularly so I was hoping to talk to someone for advice
I'm a high schooler student at Poolesville High School in Maryland
Sorry, I didn't even introduce myself
Sure
Alright thanks! I just wanted to ask for some advice on burning out
I have some questions I'd like to ask him
Zach*
Hey do you know a way I can reach Zachary
Oh alright, thanks!
Hey, is Maryland getting a bus to Hack UMBC?
Awesome, thanks so much!
Hey, I'm a HS Hacker at Poolesville High School in Montgomery County, MD. I usually prefer to bus up to hackathons with UMD but I have no way of finding out when UMD is getting a bus. I asked Jeff Hilnbrand and he to talk to you.
Awesome thanks!
Yeah I understand. What did you use to make it? LaTeX?
Would you mind sending it to me?
I was wondering if you'd mind me asking if it's a template and if so, sharing it with me?
Hey I saw your resume in HH Websites and Resumes and really liked the layout!
...
What is your profile picture?
alright thanks
how come?
My other options are working with a researcher at UMD or at a DC tech company
They can't tell me what I'm going to be doing (apparently it's confidential) so I'm afraid that I'll be stuck with a project that doesn't interest me
I got an offer but I'm on the fence about it
from cyberpatriot though?
from cyberpatriot?
Hey do you know anyone who interned at Northrop Annapolis Junction?
Get better!
Well thanks anyways
Alright
Oops
Codeday
I think I met you at a coded at?
Cause I know you do both
I really enjoy making things and was wondering if you had any advice on blending dev w/ cyber
All recognition for CS at my school is cyber
I tried it out
Ik
Ok
Yeah I've heard of that
?
CTFs and cyber
I tried it a couple years back but I didn't really like CTFs. Now I'm picking it back up because I'm thinking that maybe I just haven't done enough
Yeah
Literally our CS team has become nothing but cyber so it's kinda frustrating as a dev
I go to Poolesville High School in Maryland (if you know where that is) and we're a huge cyber school
CTFs and cyber were never really my thing
I really like dev and going to hackathons but idk
CSAW High School forensics
Dev
We're in the 20s but it's my first CTF since I usually do Devon
I'm doing HSF right now and I feel like I'm holding my team back
Yeah
Maybe a list of important tools or something?
CTFs*
Hey do you know of any resources that could help someone improve at cars?
I heard from someone that you were one of the OGs and was wondering what the size of the team was back then
Hey, I'm a Junior at PHS and I'm currently applying for grants for FRC.
cool
nah haha I was just wondering
How many people are you estimating are gonna be there?
What do you mean?
more to be directed to the right people
we don't need an insane amount of money
Nah, sponsoring our team haha
Do you think Lockheed would be interested in sponsoring lol?
Awesome, that sounds good.
Hey, do you have a list of the teams that are going to be there?
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
I'm captain this year
2404048112
Cool
glenn.r.phs@gmail.com
Yeah sure I'll talk to the captains
About doing
What are you thinking
Yep
Why
Yeah
Aren't you undefeated?
I think we play you guys this Thursday
Poolesville
Do you go to RM now?
that was so geeky
Someone I follow retweeted your video of Maggie singing Stitches
I knew your name sounded familiar haha
Hey you went on to College Gardens right?
I didn't think they would actually have anything
I literally just searched "php" in the gifs haha
<3
Can I teach you PHP?
I'll get it tomorrow
I'm about to sleep can you hold on to it for me
awesome thanks!
yep
Oops that was supposed to be a ?
Hey who was the MongoDB rep at HackTJ!
I was just confused about the counselor and bus route parts since I don't go to fcps
?*
Hey, for the HackTJ forms, which parts do  we need to fill out.
Sure, it's no trouble at all
As for suggestions, on my computer your picture is cut off for some reason
Yep! Just something for myself since I've heard that writing is a really good way to reflect.
Jekyll, that's what it was
I just stumbled on it
Yeah
Hey what did you use to make your blog?
I'll talked to him then, thanks again!
Yeah I know Fox
I'll be sure to relay this along!
Oh I see, thanks so much!
Did you just ask him if they had any openings
He was just wondering if you applied blind or there was a specific opening that you applied for
Did you intern at MITRE cause I have a friend who really wants to get a internship for cyber security there
I'll *
I think I probably apply anyways just for the hell of it
I mean yeah haha
did you have an actual idea?
Hey did you apply to the Thiel Fellowship last year?
sorry for the late response lol
alright cool
it in*
was in that format exactly?
On the bottom right on the back it says something like "batch [#]"?
I'm designing t-shirts for my FIRST robotics team and remember really liking a detail on MLH's.
Hey you interned at MLH right?
I'll let you know how it goes!
Alright thanks
people who have
We have a ton of interest in cs but not much in hackathons. My goal is to try to convince more students to come.
Hey Jared! I'm going to be giving a short presentation to students at my high school next week to promote PennApps and hackathons in general. I know you founded HackBCA so I was wondering if you had any tips?
All yours
We'll probably each take a section
we shared it with him
oh shit I didn't actually see that
alright sounds good
Hey are you available to go on the cyber presentation right now?
Alright, thanks! I checked the prices on Amazon and I'd prefer to buy there (Prime free shipping). Thanks so much anyways!
$67?
How much would that be total?
Hey, I'm interested in purchasing a prototyping kit (w/ Arduino), a additional Arduino UNO R3 and a Bluetooth/Wifi pack. I live in Maryland and my zip code is 20878. Could you give me an estimate of how much it would cost for shipping?
There's some team doing abctf from Poolesville and they had something about Overwatch in their team name
Do you need money for overwatch?
My bad that was an accident
/

np
I promise
We could have done that or this
Assignment 4
it was one or the other
Yeah
<3

Just like colors and shit
You don't
And you're good
Change some stuff
Import it into MIT App inventor
Download the source
Scroll down
Go to that link
http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/displaying-maps.html
It's basically just an app called Map It where you enter the name of a location and it pulls it up on Google Maps
I'm about to sice your life
hullo
no
hey
The second one is form B
Form A
For both forms
I have one of them
There are two problems
?
but the forms are different
We had one today
Maybe
But they'll probably be different
This was one form
Hold up
I'm not actually mad at anyone LMAO
At myself haha
They were just me being pissed
They're not shots
Yeah
I have the math quiz too
I'm not talking to you
hey man
nah
I know
230
The high technology one
Try the other one
We're on the second floor
Walk through the door
Alright
We did alright
I don't know what he's doing :/
What
But I'll be doing college visits in that area during spring break
I'm going
I know you're in Bethesda but it's closer than New Jersey haha
It's probably gonna be at the Montgomery College germantown campus
Damn that blows
Can you spread the word around to anyone who'd be interested at BCC?
I'm trying to get them to send a bus to Montgomery County
Hey, are you going to HackBCA?
I see. Thanks man, I go to Poolesville and am thinking about organizing a bus to go to a couple of hackathons a year. Still just an idea. I'll keep you posted!
Awesome, I saw that you guys had a team do EasyCTF! I know you're relatively new to the school but do you know if you guys have a computer science team?
Hey it's Glenn, we met at CodeDay DC. Whenever you have time, I'd just like to ask you some things about what Shreyas did at your old high school and the amount of kids at BCC interested in CS. Thanks!
Thought*
Alright that's what I though haha
What are you running?
I see
What's it called?
Hey I saw your terminal in CDT and was wondering what the blue tag showing the directory path is called
Do you still have Brandon's Source America research paper
Yo
I just saw you in HS Hackers and I thought you sounded familiar haha
Oh I go to Poolesville too
You know Kent?
Yooo
Yo Sreejan, do you still have your SourceAmerica paper?
Hi, I'm a junior at Poolesville High School in Maryland. I recently stumbled an article by Bloomberg about how you landed your dream job at Facebook and was wondering whether you'd be open to summer interns. Thanks!
I saw
sup homie
sup dood
thanks
I'll try!
good luck!
alright see ya later man
it has it's pros and cons
so when something big like that goes through, students will automatically connect it with the smob
people know very little about the smob throughout the year
Yeah
and just one thing that people will definitely talk about is the elimination of semester exams
Yeah I will
I have to go study for my stat exam haha
good luck
nice
so it's really important to lock up votes beforehand
the debate is really only for the people that haven't made up their minds
I will haha
so if it comes up in the "debates" you'll be good
but it'd be really good to know all the limitations smob has
I know
cause Eric's been doing this for a year
You're going to really have to know your stuff
Yep it is
that's the point
It's okay to brag a little
sounds good
I just finished writing my resume and it's tough to find a balance between the 2
I know lol
eric barely won
though last year's vote was super close
Yeah, I've heard
yeah I know you can it's just the people who voted for him last year did so for a reason and you'd have somehow sway them
Eric's going to be tough
no idea who she is
she doesn't go to rm
oh nevermind
prim?
you know who is?
just a precaution ya know
I usually wait to see who's running first before I back someone completely though
yeah
yeah sure
We usually send as many people as we can to nom con every year
we a pretty small group and I know mostly everyone
if you need poolesville's delegation I got you
hmmm
Mrs. Hicks is usually pretty cool about those things
Yeah that's strange
Yessir
which one?
unless you're already on it haha
If you want help making a website hit me up
Yo
What is their intensity level?
I'm looking for internships this summer and was thinking about applying to their Summer Academy
I was wondering what the experience was like.
You went to the Make School Summer Academy last year right?
Hey man
Why are you studying if your kids are locked outside?
You live in an airport?
In the snow?
Fuck your grandma
ayy lmao
test me motherfucker
ok
it is indeed
Your ears and your head? That's terrible
I hope you feel better.
What is the weather like?
What is the weather like
Golden State Warriors
Who is the NBA champion?

How are you planning to go?
What'd they say?
It's like 35 minutes away lol

Hey, I'm a member of HH and have been seeing your name around. I'm a high school student who's knows front-end, Python and Java but would like to learn some back-end so that I could build complete web apps. I was wondering what you'd recommend?

It's all good thanks
Hey any updates?
Alright
?
Hey are you able to give me a count of how many people from Poolesville have signed up?
Awesome, I'll spread the word.
Since just because someone applies doesn't mean they'll be accepted
How many people need to apply to be considered for a bus?
I'll*
just did it, I let people know
When do applications close?
Sounds great!
a lot* oops
but there are a people interested from my school
I could definitely find a way myself
But they'll probably have a TON of people lol
I live in Montgomery County, Maryland. We could share a bus with TJ since we're about 35 minutes away from them
I was just wondering if it's possible for you guys to send buses
Hey, do you know who's organizing HackBCA?
I'm located in Montgomery County, Maryland
I was just wondering if it's possible for you guys to send buses
Hey, are you organizing HackBCA?
Ok
Bless your Cable Magic holders for the PWMs are a lifesaver
Yeah
I want it to read my messages and talk like me
I'm using a autogenerated one on localtunnel
Yep
With Facebook messenger
Nah botkit
I got a boilerplate chat bot working and I'm gonna try and figure something out
Still not real sure lol
Gotchu
If you want one
They have water bottles too
medium right?
I got you a shirt
Just boarding lol
Idk about that one
He's reasonably smart but obsessed with winning
The guy I was with at TJ
Don't care that much about winning if I can learn a lot
Isaiah needs a teammate but I can't fade
Nope
Just gonna be late
I never get to just sit and wait for time to pass
It's not too bad
Flight delayed a ton
I'll do my best to help you do that lol
Stuck in the airport
Not there yet
I'll figure something out
Nah
Me too man
I'll try and grab you one
What time is it?
That's whackkkk
What class is it?
That actually sucks like fuckk
I'm gonna be all alone lol
Damn
You're lying
You wanna make a group chat or nah
Alright cool

I was*
Oh I wasn't suggesting that we copy I more saying that'd I'd like go have a cool project too
I've seen some others people's stuff that sound really cool though
I have no ideas
Have you thought of anything for MHacks yet?
When are you going?
5*
From 4-9
I'll probably be there the whole time
About what?
How UMD so far?
Been pretty busy with robotics and debate :/
Haven't gotten the chance to look at it yet
Did it at some point
But I'm pretty sure you could run a VM
My family has a iMac
Nah
They gave me $100 o.O
just cause I have school that monday lol
I'm probably gonna ride the bus up and fly back
hell yeah
LITT
yeah
Are you going to MHacks
Till Wednesday
Transfer to Cancun
Thanks tho
Yeah
And FRC has a booth there
Thanks a ton, but just realized that HTN is on the same weekend as Poolesville day
Nah don't do it
thanks for the catch
pushed*
oh must have push the wrong thing once
No idea
What do you mean?
It's cool
Can you remind me the day before though?
Yeah, sure I gotcha
What do you need it for?
Yeah
Brandon wanted to work on this digital chess thing
Not sure
What's that?
Did you just call the second within the first?
Nice my b

For life
I felt like it would help me understand others better
Idk

Trying to double
I might but they don't have a business program
Isn't it hard as hell to get into?
Lol I looked on Naviance and there's one person from our school who got in
Thanks
Cool
Like the one with the hands-on interview?
What was that college that you recommended me apply to?
Where are you
Me too
Where you at
What do you mean it isn't set?
Any problems?
Can you save me a seat
Around 7:30
I think it's cleaner tho
Wrong persson lol

The booth is so beautiful <3
Cause either way this weekend is going to be doppe
Yeah not really pressed though
The amount of oculus stuff this weekend is going to be insane
Hopefuly
Castrio i think
Anthony
The director
The guy who runs it
Make School usually has some pretty good tutorials for iOS
How are you going to demo then?
Are you staying the whole time?
Tbh
And it's not even THAT bad tvh
You gotta do what you gotta do lol
VMmmmm
Why
I've been planning on learning though
No
Where is ISEF?
Oh shit that's really cool too
?
Prep session
I really know nothing about either drones or oculus
Yeah I'm going to try
How come?
Attach a camera to it and view it through an oculus
I want to make my own drone
Kind of
The email needed to be sent as a formality
Apparently all the high schoolers are still left on the list
List
I talked to the organizers and he said that I'm still on the lidt
No
Yeah I BS'ed that pretty hard
And messed around with a Nest Thermostat
I made a server that allows people without internet to get medical information
Yo
I'm busy af working on it right now
In progress
YeH
But it shouldn't be too hard since it's just interfacing the raspberry pi and the amazon voice api or whatever
Not sure
And an app to control it
And notify me whenever a sports team score
But have it also act as a Amazon Echo
So basically just build a digital clock
There*
The probably is
I'm gonna write my own python script since I'm custom building an alarm clock
It can't
Not yet still getting people to sign up
in the best division
nationally
The only thing that we could have moved on to is finals and that's top 10
Yeah
We missed the cut for finals
Regionals is past states
We made regionals for the Platinum division
In the middle of learning it right now
I'm not super familiar with Android :/
Flask all the way
yeah
Vineet missed a call from Glenn.
Put that in the group chat
Yeah I guess
just the logo
I'm thinking that we just leave the logo on the front
yeah I agree
Cause Suriya was saying that white's brighter so we'd stand out more
Or white and gold
and sponsor logos under that
A banner with our team name on the back
One big logo in the front
So basically the layout's like this
Yeah
Yeah I'm doing a R&D research paper analysis thing right now
Either tonight or tomorrow morning
Did you get the design?
When is it?
Why?
Nah
Hey
I'm trying to get a squad
Yeah
I'm trying to get a bus to go to Poolesville
Same
It's MLH sponsored too and the CEO of githubs gonna be there
New Jersey
http://hackbca.com
There's a good high school one called hackBCA
Ofc the competition is stronger
It has a much different feel to it
I mean like
HackVT?
like you get to talk to college students too
It's usually pretty lit
I'm trying to ride up with UMD though
Yeah maybe
it should be coming out soon though
Yeah I didn't either
It was my first and probably favorite hackathon I've been too.
I want to
Just registered thanks
So I don't have a @umd.edu email
Nope, I'm actually a high schooler in Montgomery County
Group?
do I need to sign up or should I just show up?
alright thanks
What time is it leaving?
Any details for the bus this Friday?
Awesome thanks!
I asked Kunal and he said you were the man to talk to haha
Hi, I was just wondering if Maryland's getting a bus to HackUMBC or VTHacks.
Thanks
It's really really helped!
I see, thanks for all the advice!
Big 4?
Like I'm really into web development and Raspberry Pis and stuff
I just wasn't sure how much I'd learn in the field I want.
I'm still deciding between Northrop, research at UMD and working at a DC startup
I see I'm looking for a mix between writing code and tinkering with stuff
What did you work on?
When did you work there?
I was hoping just to ask you a couple of questions
I applied through their CyberPatriot program and got an offer from them but I'm still on the fence about it
Hi, I saw that you interned at Northrop Grumman
What do you provide potential founders?
With a focus in starting a business which in my experience is not necessarily the way to go
That's cool, from the description it seems like a hackathon to me
what's*
Like what the mission?
What exactly is HSStartups?
Np
A mix between that and Jekyll for the blog
Like if you're making a static site, GitHub pages is the way to go
Huh, the only thing with wordpress is the load times are killer
Cause I'd recommend doing it from scratch or using Wordpress, it makes configuring a site a lot easier
Do you know HTML/CSS?
That's cool, I'd definitely recommend using GitHubs sites though
Hey, why is your website hosted on Microsoft Azure?
Yeah np
That does sound like fun though
I think you have the wrong person haha
Hmmm
Hey, I'm a high schooler looking to get into cyber security. I was just wondering if there's any good beginner CTFs or websites you'd recommend. Thanks!
Wasn't that the partner thing?
Pls
Did you get a grade on Edline for "2009B #4 + grade"?
Yo
We probably won't have enough people
It's all good
I won't know until tomorrow
About what?
I really doubt that we'll need a full bus. I talked to Su Min and she told me a little more than 20 should work fine
Maybe
Alright cool
somewhere..
There HAS to be other people
Alright cool
We have 20 people I think
That's cool
Where does Yiyi go?
If we have enough people, they'll send one over
I've already talked to them
and I need to know how many people from our area is going asap
So I'm trying to coordinate a bus from coordinate a bus from MoCo to hackBCA
Lol nice
Third wheeling but it's all good
Haha yep
Yeah, me and my team made the tax fraud app
Hi, you were at HackTJ right?
Ight cool
Hey can high school students attend hacktorials?
Hey will there be any hot glue for hardware hacks?
Ok thanks
Were*
We're we removed from the attendees list?
Hey was this email sent to everyone?
Ok thanks
Will I be on the list the day of?
Cause I was at bitcamp last year 
Is it going to be super serious or more of a formality
Yeah
Not there either :/
Sorry but can you verify that I'm signed up?
Hey again, I RSVP'ed to bitcamp but someone told me an email was sent out but I didn't get it
Ok cool
And can't find it for the life of me
Cause I misplaced mine :/
Do I need to bring a ID?
Will a email be sent out with more details?
p this year*
Hi Anthony, I was talking to Jeff and he said your organizing bitcam
Hey, you were on PR for FIRST last year right?
...is this a bot...lol
It's all good
Dean's list is HUGE!
Hey, I haven't seen you in a while and I just saw Sasha's post. Congrats!
I will
I'll bring it tomorrow
Yeah sorry I meant to respond to this earlier
Did you leave it at school today?
Hey, I think I have your red hoodie
Where you at?
Hey for the event in DC on June 11, I was wondering how many pairs of yeezy tans you have?
but I share my account with the fam and like having personal playlists
Anuj told me the same thing
Yeah
See ya dude, good luck w/ everything
yeah our sophomores go to Wallops every year too
Forgot to put some respek on it
Poolesville*
maybe if you went to poolesvile
nah
I'm doing it tomorrow w/ Anish
Nah
Yea
Hey I was wondering if you guys have any spare plushies?
What perks?
Wish*

Can you send it to me?
Do you have the pool video?
Yo
I think there should be and MLH is pretty late announcing busses
I'm trying to figure that out too
yo, I'm pretty sure only admins can accept join requests
Can you send me that Reddit thread about money management?
That's even worse
bruh
Did she seem pissed?
I'll send her a email first thing monday
Oh yeah
Why would she ask though?
I'm about to get my life ended

There are so many hackathon this season I'll find something haha
Nah that's cool, thanks for trying though
Thanks so much, let me know if there are any updates 
Hell yeah, that's be really great!
lol
Not sure how their selection process works but oh well loo
Yeah, I didn't get in 
I'm not sure yet, did they send out acceptances?
Ok cool, I'll send it over tonight
I gotta add this to our sponsor packet somehow
Good looks
Do you remember what prize we won last year?
Will do
It's in progress lol
SK and I also thought up this carnival ring toss game where they basically just throw thin rings of PVC on tools sticking out of a piece of styrofoam
We're gonna try and get last year's bot moving around
Thanks
Got ya, we're gonna try to get a booth that's closer to the main road but if that's not possible we're going to put up signs to attract people our way
Sure, cause they're asking if we want the same booth
Alright, thanks anyways
Hey, how was our booth's location at last year's Poolesville day?
no problem :)
Wally should be adding you any minute now
The majority of FTC work is done out of school
A couple minutes during lunch
However, the in school meetings are only going to be for planning what we're going to be doing at Winston's house
Yeah we do meet at Winston's house everytime and yes there are in school meetings
Yeah, it's probably going to be Saturday afternoons
If you haven't seen the kickoff video yet, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqASwcqdM6o
It's cool, we just got last year's bot running and started strategizing for this year's competition.
Nope but there are only so many spots open so we're just trying to put a list together of the people that are interested in joining
We're trying to finalize the roster
Good stuff
Hey, are you still interested in joining FTC?
Lol who?
I'm good on my receivers man
Yeah
No problem, look forward to HoyaHacks!
Not sure who'd fix it but thought I'd let you know
Hey I'm pretty sure HoyaHack's date is messed up on MLH.io
Thanks! :)
Hi! I saw that you guys were giving a workshop on using OpenCV for FTC during today's kickoff event. Unfortunately, I was unable to make it and was wondering if you'd be able to send the slides over
no problem!
https://www.spotify.com/us/family/redeem/?token=SPFnfNfmX3rew
Thanks 
Can you send me the Champions case?
Thanks! 
Could you send me the Richard Lowe(?) study?
The idea is kinda cute but don't they only do that for sports?
I guess I'll just ask McKenna who I have tomorrow lol
What'd we do during Lit and debate today?
Doesn't Sharvil?
Why?
Nah
And weighing them down
My main fear with working with people way smarter is I don't want to feel like I'm not contributing
I honestly just want to dive into a unfamiliar topic and get out of my comfort zone
Yeah
but a lot of times I don't feel like I have enough background
That's what I wanna do too
So basically what your mentality is going in
I was just wondering how you decide what to do at hackathons

Still rocking that m7
...
Nah
Imo
^
Lg g watch = best bang for buck
Depends
Get them a bunch of random sensors
Sparkfun
Lmao
Pebble
lol
what the heck
rent radios?
^
preferably two
I mean you need at least one per floor
< communication
less swag<more swag
If you have a venue that big then you need radios
Lanyards for all the attendees
True
Can't you just text and call instead of radios
Victor he said cali
Food fights? Lol
Cause ball is life
Footballl
Yesss
Beaches and hacking
Holy shit
Beaches
mike is just picking everything up
Nice
justin how long would the camp be?
nice
@ ignition
how much money do we have
victor
wait
oh shit
david what's your hackathon
and where is it stored
do we have a master list of the hardware that we have?
nice and direct lol
sure why not
nice job
amazing stuff
nice
i think
Actually they're fries
?
:'(
Justin how long would your camp be?
Damn wish I could be there
haha nice
+ I can't find the event anywhere
The MakerJam link is broken
award the prize to yourself? lol
damn that blows
Erion?
Doesn't it have a 30 fee?
I saw this on EventBrite
yeah, that would probably be fine
Ok
IK I still can't decide
That moment when hackBCA is on the same weekend as your FIRST qualifier
Savage
What's the prize lol
Good luck!
I miss like 30 minutes and have absolutely no idea what's going on
How long would it be for
#MDproblems
Justin when will details be finalized for the camp
I'm up for it
I missed this
Atlantic City retreat?
Can't wait!
We definitely need more camps and hackathons over the summer
True
Ah got it
CTFs are gaining a lot of traction
Hmmmn
But is hsctf a league or a stand alone ctf
That's only one of many
Besides hackathons we could also expand to ctfs
^
Hey!
hangout?
design?
how do we promote arts
it's most commonly called STEM
Different people call it different things but yeah
fun
^Justin mute for one hour
Let's put this in a google doc
^YES
we don't want to force them to major in comupter science
that's a little too agressive
We don't want to spend time and effort to develop our brand and then rebrand later on
I agree with Justin here. Might as well rebrand now
let's narrow it down to 5-10 and post the survey in HS hackers
good idea
jk haha
savage
^
Sure
I'm not exactly sure why were disassociating ourselves from other communities when they are the people we want in ours
where students can learn and feel welcome at hackathons
We are looking to establish a community
Do we have a mission statement or something of the sort?
HSH sounds very clean
our goal is to change that
there's a stigma involved with the word "hacker"
we go to hackathons
exactly
?\
haha
Hackers*
The United Hacker of America
HSH
HS hackathons
what do you mean by work out?
very few people say Major League Hacking but instead MLH
exactly
HSHL
on a HS level
Our goal is very similar to theirs
I'm confused on why we have to steer away from MLH
^true
Its a movement so we shouldn't be afraid of using "hack" in our name
whether we like it or not
but we go to "hackathons"
HS Hacking
lmao
how does this relate back to what we're doing?
I agree with justin
Likewise. I'd just like to play around with the design
Ignition stickers 
Yeah I agree
Tons of people just don't know about HH
Yeah its all about getting out there
ok
Do you have a timeline?
Got it
I see
What are you thinking for communication?
Hey!
Sorry
I can't go
Goodnight
But I'll actually have to see. Schools a pain
Haha that's really tempting
I'll come if I finish but nothings really definite
Idk
Id prefer to come though

It's like pitch black
And I have at least 3 hours of homework
I don't get home till 7
Sorry probably not

Hey guys, for the weekend homework I put the questions (that Mrs. Wilder had on the board) on a Google Doc. We need to answer 2 questions, but so that we have varied answers/opinions I split us into 2 groups; Katie & June along with me & Calvin. Each group answers BOTH questions.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.
are you kidding me you little piece of shit ill have you know i graduated top of my politics class and ive been involved in privilege checking with over 150 confirmed political demonstrations im trained in conflict resolution and i was the most oppressed person in my entire upper middle class high school you are nothing to me but another cultural appropriator i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which have never been seen on this side of the 49th parallel mark my words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker, as we speak im checking with my anarcho-communist analyst brigade for your location so you better be prepared to deal with some molotov cocktails and angry feminists flying through your window yOURE FUCKING DEADCHERRY! i can be anywhere at any time and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with me boring you to death while i talk about privilege not only am i extensively trained in hotline management but i have access to an entire arsenal of sociological articles to prove my point and i will use them to wipe your fucking face off the earth you little shit if only you had known what oppressed retribution your cultural appropriation would unleash then maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt youre fucking dead kiddo

I prefer a bow and arrow.
@andrew I partialed both shotgun and rifle this summer LOL.

Hi Andrew! In case you didn't take the time to read the messages, we're watching Paranoia at Rio on the 20th. The times will be from 5:30/6:00 to 9:30/10:00. It's not finalized since we can't get the movie schedule yet. We're going to first watch the movie and then have dinner. 
THEN WHY DIDN"T YOU REPLY?!?! and why Karan. Oh yeah. India.
Well I'm tired. sooo. BYES.
LOL.
That's so true!
Thanks Ishan. 
I can. 
True story.
Same logic.
Just cause you're flexible doesn't mean everyone should know. I don't tell everyone I'm awesome even though I am.
Slutting?
Why does Miley look like shit now. Cause it's hip.
Cause it's hip.
Thanks Alicia!
SIKE.
Addi thought she was taller than me.
I hate all the Starbucks pictures on Instagram.
Die.
I shot a .22 cal rifle and shotgun this summer. It was exhilarating.
HI STUTI.

STUTI left...
He's Exotic. Like Raj.
Date Ishan.
Addi would.
Haha.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfeys7Jfnx8

Addi.  We know you don't care about sports and exercise. It shows. ;)
Oh ok.
I'm going to finish high school. Go to college. Work for Google. Start a company to make the world a better place. Get married at 25 and have kids between 25-30. Continue working. Raise kids. Mid-life crisis. Continue awesoming. Retire. Buy the Celtics. Make them awesomer. Die.
I WANT TO GO TO HARVARD <3
It was the first thing that popped into my hea...nevermind
Glad I could find a nice topic...
Let's talk about hot guys. Stuti's favorite topic.
Hwelo hwelo. 
Sorry! Let's move to a different topic. If you want to start a fight. Talk about religion and politics. 
caused*
I'm saying that Obamacare cause tons of middle class families to lose decent jobs. Some companies didn't want to give their full time employees healthcare so they made many employees part-time. This resulted in the person needing to find another part-time job in order to support their family. And still. No healthcare. 
@ Ishan. I'm sure the middle class LOVES Obamacare.
Bill Clinton as a person D:
Bill Clinton as a president :D
You're indian...
Andddddddd we're back.
Beacuse the topic is something none of us can relate to.
http://theprincesshours.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/g-dragon.jpg
Ummm.
Stuti's talking about me of course.
I'd pass.
D:
np.
You know what else looks good? Katie Holmes. 
HAHA. Jessica's brother is the best.
Typical Rachel. I'm guessing she slapped those little kids too.
'pictures'.

My friend Calvin is running for SMOB and it would be great if you could support him by liking his pagr
Haha
As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

I just want to say the Beantown management doesn't view this week as a loss, we see it as a learning experience. We'll be back next week stronger than ever, we had a tough opponent who played well and got lucky this week, and some of our key players let us down. But we will work 24/7 to correct our flaws and fortify our strengths. Thank you all and God bless America. No further questions.

Hey is the board cleaned up
Did you get the Udoo and kinect wired?
I'm gonna check how to secure it but I haven't been able to find anything

When a lot of teams lose connection to the bot they blame it on the field
Even if something comes loose for a second, we're done for the round

Did anything shake loose during practice?
I'm not sure how we're going to secure those let me check real quick

Hey guys, 
After much deliberation, I've also decided to run for captain next year. This upcoming season will be my 3rd FIRST robotics season and in the past two years, I've been able to see what works well and what, well, not so much. As captain, I would bring both experience from FTC (as a captain) and SGA (both county and local) to our team. 
A important part of each FRC season is pitching to possible sponsors and this is where I feel like I would bring the most to the table. I have networked with large technology companies all over the DMV (D.C, Maryland, Virginia) area who have shown an interest in supporting teams like us and I believe that in order to reach the 2015-2016 estimated budget of $30,000, raising money will have to be one of the primary focuses.
I look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow and if you have any questions, feel free to call or text me at 240-404-8112.
finalizing it
bout to
and you can tell me if it makes me seems like I have that EC or nah
When it's done I'll send it to you
alright
have one in the making
ngl
I'm pretty worried
I'm gonna be running for FIRST captain tomorrow and if I could get your vote, that'd be awesome bro

Oh yeah.  I'm doing track too.  Join the club. 
Yeah... 
No.  I'm at Busch Gardens and they perform there on Sunday but I have to go home tomorrow.  :'(
I'm missing a Hot Chelle Ray concert on Sunday.  Fuckkkkkk. 
Why can't I be in VA? 
Hey. 
I completely agree with SK but take in mind anyone can apply to the magnet program. These are things that we have worked towards. The magnet program is the magnet program for a reason. We're essentially the face of MCPS. Everyone wants the treatment that magnet students get but not everyone can be in the magnet program. We are filled with motivated and responsible students who are able to manage their time wisely. There are priorities and things more important in life than just fun. I'm not looking down on the normal students at all. I just feel that the few people who are arguing against the magnet program need to realize that everyone has the same opportunities. You need to grasp the moment and plan ahead.

I'm pretty sure Takoma don't have Boston anymore.
I think he is*
Yeah he is I think.

I know.
No we can't? Right?
Lunch is going to be awesome for you guys.
Yeah. They sound awesome. 
Then have fun!
I feel like RM is going to seriously suck for you unless you like writing. You can still get really good grades and stuff but it won't be the best experience.

Everyone said she was a bad teacher.

Lol thanks fine
Pic?
hold up
I lied
DRIVE AUTOMATICALLY ADDS A WHITE BACKGROUND
UGH
it's not done
just wait
the box is a different color
the box is to show that the elements are associated w/ each other
they'res a box behind it
it is white
still deciding
im thinking of taking it into adobe fireworks or something and removing the background
what do you have in mind
but this is so small and imformal and short that's its a whole other style all together
if I was giving an actual pitch, i might use that
max.
We're talking for like 2 minutes karl
they're two different things
cause you're not letting me finish before you ramble on
karl relax
AND BLOW IT UP
Cause I still need to remove the background
don't overcomplicate things
blown
they'll be blow up
they're not tiny
lol
it's just to give a quick visual of how it works
if this was at the end when we're presenting our device then we'd have a larger presentation
quick, simple and sweet
its a pitch
most people don't even have a presentation and thats the idea
Having a bunch of slides is gonna look dumb
its better to be short and sweet and not have too many distractions
its a quick pitch
i can't get this spacing right
goodnight
nah
its gud
don't worry bout it
alright
can i get it w/ that white background tho

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB.

Hey! I'm a 8th grade student at Roberto Clemente. I'm looking to get more involved with SGA and I'm wondering whether I'm able to apply for the MCR-SGA Executive Board as of now? Or should I start with something smaller? Any advice would be nice. I'm a bit confused! Haha. 
Thanks, 
Glenn Ren
As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB. Thanks!

You wanna keep your SMCS certificate right?
So my mentality is basically just I'm gonna do what's best for me cause in 2 years you'll be irrelevant af in my life
I'm sorry man, for me I'm lucky enough to have a good relationship with Mr. Estep where I'm not gonna need any hardcore SMCS teachers to write me a rec

As both an active member of MCR and and a student at Poolesville, I have the opportunity to interact with Calvin in a variety of environments.  Calvin is incredibly personable and approachable, but I am also amazed by how driven Calvin in everything he does and how he is always thinking of new ideas to fight for the student voice. Calvin is both committed and experienced, and is exactly what we need in our next SMOB. Please take a moment to support Calvin by liking his Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/CalvinforSMOB. Thanks!
What did we have to draw for history?
do you know anyone good at video editing?
I'm doing that completely at school
yeah
haha np.
???
awkward*
awkard
is ishan going
idk
they're just a ridiculous amount of homework this weekend
yeah
Yeah I can only stay for 2 hours
For 2 hours
sure
except during the superbowl
Either day works for me
sunday after the superbowl is pretty late
Most computers don't have a microsd reader... They only have a SD card reader. To move anything to the PC for either phone all you need the charging cable. You just plug it into the computer and you're ready to go!
The external storage is not awesome. Just ask Alexis. It can only hold picture and music and such. Btw. The 32gb HTC one is $199. The 16gb s4 is also $199. 
only*
That's true. Oh I forgot to mention, the s4 has a back panel of plastic which allows for a removal battery and a addition microsd card. The microsd on holds multimedia though.
And thanks for the compliment Da ;D
And now onto the screen. The HTC One has 468 ppi vs. the s4's 441 ppi.
The HTC One has a 4 'Ultrapixel' camera compared to the Galaxy s4's 13 Ultrapixel. The Ultrapixel actually just a marketing term used by HTC for Megapixels. More pixels = sharper images. Though on a phones screen they all look the same. The 4 'Ultrapixel' camera is better for taking low light photos. They both feature a 1080p video recording quality so no difference there. 
*appear
Sense 5 is cleaner than TouchWiz but TouchWiz has more features. Most of them which I don't feel are super useful. Also, the One features Boomsound from Beats which is excellent. It's the only flagship that has speakers facing the actually user (you would have thought the designers had more common sense). Additionally the HTC is cut out of a solid block of aluminum so the build quality is amazing. The s4 has a 4.99 inch screen which is a bit too big for my tastes compared to the 4.7 on the One. Moving on to the buttons; the HTC One has 2 capacitive buttons, 'back' the right and 'home' on the left. The HTC logo in the center is meant for decoration only (though I heard if you root the phone you can turn it into a home button). On the S4 you have 3 buttons. 2 capacitive and 1 physical, with the physical button in the center. Buttons in order from left to right (back, home, menu). I actually prefer this setup over the One's but once you use the HTC One enough you get used to it. Adding on the the buttons on the One; since you don't have a menu button, you are stuck with a 3 dot panel in the bottom of some apps which is pretty annoying). Keep in mind that the HTC One runs Android 4.1.2 while the s4 runs 4.2.2. Rumors say that once HTC updates their UI, then the menu will disappear.

^
extend*
entend*
They'll have to extent it
^^
I'm out, this is ridiculous.
how you're so dillusional
That's actually a little concerning
lol
Because we have one of the best quarterbacks of all time, the best coach of the modern era, and a good team.
I mean it's very basic human psychology, you like the Giants (who aren't a very good team in general), see the Patriots who are a consistently good team, and decide to use the excuse that they cheated (which I admit we did) to make yourself feel better about your jealousy.
Jesus Christ, trying to have a discussion with you is like talking to a 5 year old
You lack an ounce of respect since the Giants are the most inconsistent team in the NFL (which is why Tom Coughlin was fired) and are jealous that we are in contention year in and year out.
Hilarious
You know when people use that?
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ad+hominem
I'm not sure why you're actually so confused, whether you really don't get it or you're too blind with hate for arguably the best player of all time.
but you use that same thing to take away from everything we've done over the last 7 years.
We cheated during spygate in 2007.
that's the definition of being a sore loser
so you find excuses to put down our achievements
I'm calling you a sore loser cause you can't just accept we're a good team with the best NFL dynasty of all time
It's called being a sore loser
Cause you're salty that we're so good
You try to use that excuse over and over again
It starts with the o-line.
But I'm not
you're honestly too blind to appreciate greatness but that's your loss
how did our offense suck
why
it's pretty simple
You just find any reason to put down tom brady cause you hate on him
Our O-Line sucked. How is that on brady?
Hate us cause you ain't us.
I really don't see how you think they can pull this off
your funeral
ok
ok
The panthers are really good on both sides of the field
but their offense is pretty mediocre
Their defense is good
^
Karan you're making a mistake
though we would have matched up better
we had no o-line and would have gotten stomped by the panthers in the super bowl
it's done
we lost
not really
which isn't going to happen
the only chance that the broncos has is von miller destroying cam
That's going to be a beat down
Eshwar?
y u do dis
Bruh
alone*
The struggle of running along
I'm sorry but imo that struggle < the struggle of going to school

yeah but if you're gonna go on pirate bay, the silk road or watch porn then you're probably gonna need to use your data
haha this is what i do
I lied, BCC is part of Cohort 2 while Poolesville is part of Cohort 3
The "Bring Your Own Device to School" policy and the open Wi-Fi  are only part of a larger MCPS Strategic Technology Plan.
Unfortunately Poolesville is part of the last group of schools so even though there is no specific date on when we will implement it, it  will definitely be before the next fiscal school year begins.
BCC is part of one of the first groups of schools that MCPS is implementing this policy in.
The schools don't have any control over this as it's a countywide rollout.
high schools*
So recently MCPS implemented a "Bring Your Own Device" Policy for all high school
This
